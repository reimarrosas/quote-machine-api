I shall not grow conservative with age.;Elizabeth Cady Stanton;age

I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety.

The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.;Carol Burnett;age

What is wrong with the Iranians in addition to the nuclear bomb? This is the only country on Earth in the 21st century that has renewed imperialistic ambitions. They really want to become the hegemon of the Middle East in an age that gave up imperialism.;Shimon Peres;age
I think it's quite extraordinary that people cast me as if I'm Warren Beatty: until I met my present wife, at the age of 35, you could name two girlfriends.;Colin Firth;age
Craziest thing I've done for love is getting married. I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy, crazy, crazy. I'm never going to say I wouldn't do it again but I have to make sure it's love and not settling for the 'I have to do this by a certain age,' which is kind of what I did.;Jenny McCarthy;age

Young man, the secret of my success is that an early age I discovered that I was not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;age

I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me. And the fact they had cameras in their hands made that legal.;Sienna Miller;age

Although it is generally known, I think it's about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.;Douglas Horton;age
I think it's your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that's a waste of a lovely life. 'Oh... I'm 30, oh, I'm 40, oh, 50.' Make the most of it.;Betty White;age
No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.;Rowan Atkinson;age
What goes on in Europe concerns us greatly because, if Europe comes apart, the E.U. comes apart, then you're going to have enormous impact on America, that's a very big trading partner of ours, and people own securities around the world in this day and age.;Michael Bloomberg;age
Your body actually reminds you about your age and your injuries - the body has a stronger memory than your mind.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;age
People dance at any age.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;age
I never had little brothers, so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age! I learned what 'pull my finger' meant the hard way.;Danica McKellar;age
My sister and I shared a bedroom our entire lives and I believe she discovered the Beatles when she was about 11 and I'm four years younger.

Pepper band.;Christina Ricci;age
But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history. I think I'm very representative of many of the thought processes my generation have been through and, by and large, people of my age have had their imprint planted on the consciousness of western society for a long time.;Tom Hanks;age
I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something. I think, if anything, the press kind of, because of my gender and my age, tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It's part of the cultural dynamic, I guess.;Ani DiFranco;age
What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don't think my mother had that opportunity to change.;Jeanne Moreau;age
I've never worried about age.;Jeanne Moreau;age
To me age is a number, just a number. Who cares?;Jeanne Moreau;age

Everyone talks about age, but it's not about age. It's about work ethic. Winning never gets old.;Lisa Leslie;age
Age is a terrible avenger. The lessons of life give you so much to work with, but by the time you've got all this great wisdom, you don't get to be young anymore.;Elizabeth Wurtzel;age
Science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation, but you can't construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history.;John Polkinghorne;age
I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.;William J. Clinton;age
'Dallas' hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.;Larry Hagman;age
I've never been more in love with anyone nearly half my age than I am today. I'd get married in a minute if I weren't still married to somebody else.;Rod Stewart;age
At my age you don't go into fatherhood lightly.;Rod Stewart;age
I didn't know a time when there wasn't a war because I spent all my time from the age of two or three to eight in a coal cellar really.;David Bailey;age
My best friend just had a baby, and she's my age. So I'm a godmom now, which is crazy.;Kristen Stewart;age
I think I'm a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking. It's not about being shameful, I'm just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing, and it probably started at age 15. I can be around people and say what I think without fear.;Kristen Stewart;age
At a certain age, death becomes familiar to you-or a loss becomes familiar-the tragedies that are more commonplace in life.;Jessica Lange;age
TV is sort of the only way to go for an actress my age to make a decent salary with independent films, you just can't.;Jessica Lange;age

At its best our age is an age of searchers and discoverers, and at its worst, an age that has domesticated despair and learned to live with it happily.;Flannery O'Connor;age
Study after study confirms that even when you control for variables like profession, education, hours worked, age, marital status, and children, men still are compensated substantially more - even in professions, like nursing, dominated by women. No wonder there's a gender gap.;Dee Dee Myers;age
I learned from a very young age that if I pursued the things that truly excited me, that they would reward in more important ways, like happiness.;Brandon Boyd;age
I always wanted to be a designer. I read books on fashion from the age of 12.;Alexander McQueen;age
When I was a little kid I used to play with guys twice my age, so, I was the last one picked, so if I picked I knew that I had to get the ball to the scorer if I wanted to stay on the court, so that was pretty much my job.;Jason Kidd;age
We have become a society that can't self-correct, that can't address its obvious problems, that can't pull out of its nosedive. And so to our list of disasters let us add this fourth entry: we have entered an age of folly that - for all our Facebooking and the twittling tweedle-dee-tweets of the twitterati - we can't wake up from.;Thomas Frank;age
The divine right of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may, it is hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without danger.;Mary Wollstonecraft;age

I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately, you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.;George Clooney;age
Even truth needs to be clad in new garments if it is to appeal to a new age.;Georg C. Lichtenberg;age
You can have a spiritual awakening and discover a new side of you at any age. And best of all, love can happen at any age. Life can just start to get exciting when you're in your 40s and 50s. You have to believe that.;Salma Hayek;age
America doesn't reward people of my age, either in day-to-day life or for their performances.;Meryl Streep;age
I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that.;Evel Knievel;age
I think I'm past the age of getting lost.;Amanda Seyfried;age
I conceived in art college at the age of 20, near the end of term.;Joni Mitchell;age
I've been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family, 'Work out! Work out! Old age is coming!';Cher;age

Whoever, fleeing marriage and the sorrows that women cause, does not wish to wed comes to a deadly old age.;Hesiod;age
Age has been the perfect fire extinguisher for flaming youth.;Navjot Singh Sidhu;age
I prefer younger men. In some ways, they are much more open to a woman being stronger and independent then some of the men my age.;Kim Cattrall;age
You have to be desirable. And that's why so many woman of my age or even younger are pushed to Botox and plastic surgery, all the things that people say, 'Why do women do this?' Where do you go in your 50s in your career?;Kim Cattrall;age
It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not?;Arthur Miller;age
I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships, which I hope lessens a little bit with age.;Lena Dunham;age

One of the many pleasures of old age is giving things up.;Malcolm Muggeridge;age

If you explode onto the scene at a very young age, there are so many people pulling you in different directions. It takes time to recalibrate and see what's important.;Clive Owen;age
Situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life. In the Age of Obama, however, such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite. The less you know the better.;Michelle Malkin;age
We virtually never feel our age, but thinking that we should can lead to disaster.;Martha Beck;age
We grew up in a very creative environment and were exposed to the arts at a very young age, so it's not a surprise that all of us are in some form of the arts.;Spike Lee;age

I wanted to do two things when I was growing up, about your age. I wanted to play in the NBA, and I wanted to be a businessman after my basketball career was over, and that is what I am doing now.;Magic Johnson;age
The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me. Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60, saying: 'I could've been Bond. Buy me a drink.' That's the saddest place I could be. At least now at 60 I can say: 'I was Bond. Now buy me a drink.';Daniel Craig;age
There's a vintage which comes with age and experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;age
It's not the normal way to look at things but I experienced death at a really young age and because of that it's been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible.;Cate Blanchett;age
I've an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children, and I grew up with my grandmother in the household. And so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother! It was great growing up with so many generations of women.;Cate Blanchett;age
Every age develops its own peculiar forms of pathology, which express in exaggerated form its underlying character structure.;Christopher Lasch;age
I love my kids, and the moments I have with them, and it's kind of weird, it's such an age old cliche, but the way that my sons, the way they make me feel when I look at them, the way they say things, no one else would probably react to them, but it's a special thing for me.;Michael Rapaport;age
There's a very small group of elite actresses who are my age, who people want to work with. It's not easy to get a good job with good actors.;Amanda Peet;age
A final word: I am not knowledgeable about the internet. I do not have a computer. I guess that at 74 years of age, I don't have the patience to learn.;David Wilkerson;age
It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.;Vaclav Havel;age
We tried not to age, but time had its rage.;Patti Smith;age
Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been finding a lot of work recently because she doesn't like what a woman her age is offered. That's a real double standard. You get Sean Connery, who gets older and older, still playing opposite young ladies, but it doesn't work the other way around.;Denzel Washington;age
Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.;David Mamet;age
My wife and I, unlike many intellectuals, spent five years working on assembly lines. We came to fully understand the criticisms of the industrial age, in which you are an appendage of a machine that sets the pace.;Alvin Toffler;age
Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
At this age, I should be leading a quiet life.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
Any new financial order for the world must tackle the three chief challenges of our age.;James Buchan;age
There are signs that the age of petroleum has passed its zenith. Adjusted for inflation, a barrel of crude oil now sells for three times its long-run average. The large western oil companies, which cartellised the industry for much of the 20th century, are now selling more oil than they find, and are thus in the throes of liquidation.;James Buchan;age
With the song 'This Christmas' I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist. So I wanted to bring my flavor to the song so when people over the age of 45 or 50 hear it they'll be like 'OK, he did his thing with that record.' It's like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic.;Chris Brown;age
In an age when the fashion is to be in love with yourself, confessing to be in love with somebody else is an admission of unfaithfulness to one's beloved.;Russell Baker;age

I believe the true function of age is memory. I'm recording as fast as I can.;Rita Mae Brown;age
So Harry Potter came in and it is nice that I have kids of the right age. I took them to London and they walked around the set and met Harry Potter and that is thrilling.;Gary Oldman;age
All we can do when we think of kids today is think of more hours of school, earlier age at the computer, and curfews. Who would want to grow up in that world?;James Hillman;age
The reason for the sadness of this modern age and the men who live in it is that it looks for the truth in everything and finds it.;Edmond de Goncourt;age
No, but way before that, I've been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual.;Christopher Walken;age
There probably aren't a lot of actors my age who tap dance.;Christopher Walken;age
I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I didn't get my first job until I was 12, and two years at that age is really hard.;Anna Kendrick;age
I remember being in Hollywood at the age of 16 and marveling at the stars. The idea of being part of it never entered my mind. It was too far-fetched.;Bryan Adams;age
The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.;Shimon Peres;age
One of my grandfathers, actually, having gone out there as a minister, decided he would better serve the people as a doctor. So at a very late age - at the age of 38 in fact - he changed course and decided to become a doctor.;Colin Firth;age
I'm totally into new age and self-help books. I used to work in a bookstore and that's the section they gave me, and I got way into it. I just loved the power of positive thinking, letting yourself go.;Jason Mraz;age
It's the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It's not about age. It's about taste, and it's about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything.;Ralph Lauren;age
The reason for the slow progress of the world seems to lie in a single fact. Every man is born under the yoke, and grows up beneath the oppressions of his age.;John Jay Chapman;age
A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.;Jim Bishop;age
Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.;Gary L. Francione;age
I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.;Lillie Langtry;age
I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.;Giorgio Armani;age
Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.;Joyce Maynard;age
American Idol transcends age, gender, ethnicity, everything.;Carrie Underwood;age
You get to a certain age and you can't judge yourself on your dad or your parents.;Ellie Goulding;age
I'd like to look like Madonna when I'm her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I've always wanted to be muscly, not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around, but I'm always aware if I'm getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.;Ellie Goulding;age
I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her.;Ellie Goulding;age
I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - 'I'm going to get married at this age I'm going to have a kid at this age' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don't want my life to be based on that.;Julia Stiles;age
I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along.;Bruce Springsteen;age
Experts tell us that 90% of all brain development occurs by the age of five. If we don't begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten.;Robert. L. Ehrlich;age
When I was seventeen, I worked as a counsellor at a co-ed sleep-away camp for eight weeks. I loved it but it could be harrowing - it was far too much responsibility for someone my age.;Harlan Coben;age
Music has always been my protection against the world, from a very young age. I feel safe inside of a jam.;Trey Anastasio;age
We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed.;Lawrence Clark Powell;age
Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.;Jonathan Sacks;age
Religiosity turns out to be the best indicator of civic involvement: it's more accurate than education, age, income, gender or race.;Jonathan Sacks;age
The year I was born, 1956, was the peak year for babies being born, and there are more people essentially our age than anybody else. We could crush these new generations if we decided too.;Tom Hanks;age
Adulthood is the ever-shrinking period between childhood and old age. It is the apparent aim of modern industrial societies to reduce this period to a minimum.;Thomas Szasz;age
I was born at the age of twelve on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot.;Edward Koch;age
We live in an age of instant knowledge. And there's almost a sense of entitlement to that.;J. J. Abrams;age
It's the golden age of French cinema again but it's because Sarkozy had the guts to push through copyright law.;Harvey Weinstein;age
I started in the restaurant business at the age of 19 as a waitress. I loved the atmosphere and the camaraderie of the restaurant business. I loved not having to go to an office. I loved making people happy.;Anne Burrell;age
My view is pensioners don't have the one option that people of working age have. They can't really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work.;Iain Duncan Smith;age
Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you're of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not.;Iain Duncan Smith;age
I think you can't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can't escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.;Jack White;age
At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I'm safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too.;Richard Attenborough;age
What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can't leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age.;Diane Kruger;age
I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it so was my brother.;Eddie Van Halen;age
I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland.;Eddie Van Halen;age
When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It's like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly.;Haruki Murakami;age
We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love.;Elton John;age
I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict.;Lindsay Lohan;age
I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.;Lindsay Lohan;age
Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I'm actually overweight.;Lindsay Lohan;age
This is what I asked for, and in this day and age that's what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don't get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life.;Lindsay Lohan;age
At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.;Nicolas Cage;age
There is a certain age at which a child looks at you in all earnestness and delivers a long, pleased speech in all the true inflections of spoken English, but with not one recognizable syllable.;Annie Dillard;age
I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait.;Cameron Diaz;age
I would love a family. I'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.;Cameron Diaz;age
I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.;Cameron Diaz;age
Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine.;Isak Dinesen;age
Age for me is just a number.;Haile Gebrselassie;age
You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, 'You're a sellout, because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.' 'Top Chef' is a double-edged sword for me: There's a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I'm not in them anymore, all I do is TV.;Tom Colicchio;age
Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think.;Maya Lin;age
From an early age I didn't buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting.;Adam Clayton;age
I didn't have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age.;Adam Carolla;age
I hate the idea that you shouldn't wear something just because you're a certain age.;Miuccia Prada;age
I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.;Julie Burchill;age
As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.;Julie Burchill;age
Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.;Clarence Day;age
Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can't retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.;Bernard Baruch;age
To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am.;Bernard Baruch;age
I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it's not normal, but I just don't care. I live once.;Liz Phair;age
I've lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point.;Liz Phair;age
There's no way to approach anything in an objective way. We're completely subjective our view of the world is completely controlled by who we are as human beings, as men or women, by our age, our history, our profession, by the state of the world.;Charlie Kaufman;age
Age is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy.;Dorothy Thompson;age
Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn't just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn't working - certainly not on anything I liked, anyway - and I started to do other things.;Kiefer Sutherland;age
I grew up on the golden age of children's TV.;Edward Norton;age
I do wish I could tell you my age but it's impossible. It keeps changing all the time.;Greer Garson;age
Pretend to be dumb, that's the only way to reach old age.;Friedrich Durrenmatt;age
The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you're learning you're not old.;Rosalyn S. Yalow;age
The history of my life must begin by the earliest circumstance which my memory can evoke it will therefore commence when I had attained the age of eight years and four months.;Giacomo Casanova;age
We are in an electronic technology age now and it's about time we put away the old stuff.;Monica Edwards;age
At the age of 20 I bought a used Fiat 127. This was the only one I could afford!;Carlos Ghosn;age
At my age, I don't think anyone is untouched by cancer.;Bryan Cranston;age
We try, we fail, we posture, we aspire, we pontificate - and then we age, shrink, die, and vanish.;George Saunders;age
My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.;George Saunders;age
It is not possible to live in this age if you don't have a sense of many contradictory forces.;Rem Koolhaas;age
I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.;Zoe Saldana;age
You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.;Al Pacino;age
It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.;Jane Fonda;age
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the old metaphor: You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.;Jane Fonda;age
We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic.;Jane Fonda;age
The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year.;Jane Fonda;age
I am hoping for peaceful transition into a new age. Obama has already played a great role in initiating us into that vision. If he were to be harmed in any way, it would spawn the birth of a million Obamas.;Saul Williams;age
I definitely don't look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me.;Elijah Wood;age
The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I'm 19?;Fiona Apple;age
There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we're lifetime baby-making machines. Women's reproductive abilities start to wane when they're as young as 35. Men? We're good to go pretty much till we're dead.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
Older fatherhood isn't all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who's just getting started.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you've got an adolescent boy, you're in the sweet spot for trouble.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that's correct, because there's an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.;Maggie Smith;age
A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.;Robertson Davies;age
In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you're on 'The Golden Girls.' They age you so fast.;Gabrielle Union;age
A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations.;Ezra Pound;age
I can't get my knickers in a twist about my age and ageing in an industry that caters to the ids of 14-year-olds.;Vera Farmiga;age
I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it.;Eddie Vedder;age
By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn't a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual.;Janet Jackson;age
It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.;Kathleen Turner;age
I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing.;Rupert Everett;age
Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you.;Rupert Everett;age
I began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid.;Roberto Cavalli;age
We Jews have a special attachment to the Book. The study of page after page in tomes yellowing with age was obligatory.;Theodore Bikel;age
Having come to live in this age is as though one were to have entered another country. Learn its language or risk being left out.;Theodore Bikel;age
I don't want to look at other people my age in leather. Why would I put it on?;George Michael;age
I believe that the fight against crime starts in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children and show them love and guidance from an early age so they learn to respect the rights of others.;Blanche Lincoln;age
At an early age, I started my own paper route. Once I saw how you could service people and do a good job and get paid for it, I just wanted to be the best I could be in whatever I did.;Puff Daddy;age
Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms.;Irvin S. Cobb;age
Brain power improves by brain use, just as our bodily strength grows with exercise. And there is no doubt that a large proportion of the female population, from school days to late middle age, now have very complicated lives indeed.;A. N. Wilson;age
I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely.;Camille Pissarro;age
I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it. You see it happen, there's always the town gossip - 'Oh did you hear about so and so, or did you hear what went on in this household?' So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut.;Garrett Hedlund;age
If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.;Katherine Jenkins;age
The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age.;Lascelles Abercrombie;age
By the age of 9 or 10, I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way.;John le Carre;age
When you're my age and you see a story, you better go for it pretty quickly. I'd just like to get a few more novels under my belt.;John le Carre;age
Catholics and evangelicals need to remain allied, and in solidarity, against the increasingly aggressive secularism of our age.;Gary Bauer;age
I don't know whether it's age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price.;John le Carre;age
Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life - so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.;Jon Hamm;age
Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses.;Maggie Kuhn;age
I was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age 7, my Dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. I was hooked.;Len Wein;age
Study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance.;Thomas Moore;age
In the digital age of 'overnight' success stories such as Facebook, the hard slog is easily overlooked.;James Dyson;age
The greatest writers of this age... are aware of the mystery of our existence.;J. B. Priestley;age
The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change.;J. G. Ballard;age
My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. I watched them over the years and saw how they dealt with everything together, as a team.;Kyle Chandler;age
My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship.;Kyle Chandler;age
At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.;Naguib Mahfouz;age
I don't know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.;Joan Collins;age
I don't look my age, I don't feel my age and I don't act my age. To me age is just a number.;Joan Collins;age
I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It's crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.;Cat Cora;age
Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.;Terry Eagleton;age
We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids' diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don't buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.;Cat Cora;age
Filth and old age, I'm sure you will agree, are powerful wardens upon chastity.;Geoffrey Chaucer;age
It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship.;Henry A. Wallace;age
Working on the 'Ice Age' movies, I'm really proud to be in them.;Seann William Scott;age
No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage. No Constitutional Amendment was needed to ban polygamy or bigamy, nor was a Constitutional Amendment needed to set a uniform age of majority to ban child marriages.;Judy Biggert;age
We're taught at such a young age that you can always be better and that you're never perfect and that you're never good enough.;Shawn Johnson;age
The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.;Robert Morgan;age
Study is the bane of childhood, the oil of youth, the indulgence of adulthood, and a restorative in old age.;Walter Savage Landor;age
Because of my age and because there's more work on the small screen. What it's missing in quality it makes up for in quantity. From an actor's selfish point of view.;Cesar Romero;age
Old age is an insult. It's like being smacked.;Lawrence Durrell;age
Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.;Florida Scott-Maxwell;age
One of the great challenges of our age, in which the tools of our productivity are also the tools of our leisure, is to figure out how to make more useful those moments of procrastination when we're idling in front of our computer screens.;Joshua Foer;age
I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That's a beautiful gift from God. If people don't want to see that anymore then I won't be in anymore movies.;Debra Winger;age
Never say never, but the thought of electively cutting oneself is beyond my grasp, and I also object to it politically. Denying the lines on our faces makes a comment about age and wisdom I don't care to make.;Debra Winger;age
People pay to see movies with women looking beautiful, but I think there will be a place for me to play women looking my own age.;Debra Winger;age
There's a small club of women who are willing to age.;Debra Winger;age
I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.;Debra Winger;age
I try to write lyrics so that they won't age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.;Florence Welch;age
In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see. Whether it's on television or film or in the theatre, everything is so advertised, so trailed, that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like.;Rowan Atkinson;age
Your 40s are a major trough. About the age of 50, feelings of satisfaction begin to rebound and keep rising into your 50s, 60s and 70s, with health being a major factor.;Jane Pauley;age
I came back to work when my children were two months old. At that early age, they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls, so it wasn't a matter of them missing me. I was missing them.;Jane Pauley;age
Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things.;Joshua Lederberg;age
About the time I turned 50, I experienced the profound biological change that often accompanies women at that age. Also, I put two kids in college and lost both of my parents, so I'm no longer somebody's daughter.;Jane Pauley;age
I feel more mature than most people my age.;Leighton Meester;age
Age does not bring you wisdom, age brings you wrinkles.;Estelle Getty;age
Maybe I'll be a feminist in my old age.;Bjork;age
I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It's an emergency.;Bjork;age
You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real.;Victoria Abril;age
I think that clearly it has an influence, to be coming of age during the punk rock era, to come from a difficult and sporadically violent background, to have been in and out of such chaos, I think it actually helps. But I don't know for sure.;Craig Ferguson;age
I'd date someone younger or older age doesn't matter to me. Or looks, really - it's all about maturity.;Leona Lewis;age
Try to keep your soul young and quivering right up to old age.;George Sand;age
I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn't want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.;Harrison Ford;age
Parenting is an impossible job at any age.;Harrison Ford;age
Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She's a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades.;Alison Sweeney;age
I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.;Holly Madison;age
From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.;Gary Vaynerchuk;age
IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I'm far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read 'Tech Crunch,' 'Ad Age.' I would rather be living in the trenches. I would rather be going to Whole Foods in Columbus Circle to watch people shop with their smartphones.;Gary Vaynerchuk;age
Genius worship is the inevitable sign of an uncreative age.;Clive Bell;age
I appreciate and enjoy my age.;Nikki Giovanni;age
I've been going through photos of my mother, looking back on her life and trying to put it into context. Very few people age gracefully enough to be photographed through their aging.;Jamie Lee Curtis;age
I am rediscovering the whole sexual dimension of life at the age of 86, really. And that also means discovering the feminine. So the whole of this dimension, which I had been seeking for a very long time, is now sort of opening itself up to me.;Bede Griffiths;age
I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can't help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it's taught writers.;David Mitchell;age
Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections.;Dean Kamen;age
I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can't be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it's so dangerous for kids. So there's a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids.;Tim McGraw;age
In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we're now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.;David Mitchell;age
I want to sell to people my own age, because that's the way I write songs.;John Mellencamp;age

Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.;Patti Stanger;age
I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn't want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn't want a boss.;Barbara Corcoran;age

An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence.;Raymond Chandler;age
I've always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food.;Michael Stipe;age
There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.;Maria Callas;age

Maybe back in the day you didn't need to be the greatest looking to be on TV and you didn't need to speak the best, but in this day and age, I think you need to be the package.

I don't mind my age.;Heather Mills;age
Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn't trade. Women who lie about their age - 'why?';Demi Moore;age
For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30.;Demi Moore;age
It's a little silly to finally learn how to write at this age. But I long ago realized I was secretly sincere.;Annie Dillard;age
It's not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I'll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents.;Michael Symon;age

I'm never overawed by a situation and I think that's because I've always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29, I've always felt in control of a situation. People used to say, when you're 32, you'll look 32. I'm still waiting for that moment, where my age catches up with my appearance.;Chris O'Dowd;age
I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face.;Arthur Smith;age

Second to agriculture, humbug is the biggest industry of our age.;Alfred Nobel;age

Almost all of your life is lived by the seat of your pants, one unexpected event crashing into another, with no pattern or reason, and then you finally reach a point, around my age, where you spend more time than ever looking back. Why did this happen? Look where that led? You see the shape of things.;Ron Perlman;age
I've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.;Nicki Minaj;age

I think that everyone at any age should ask themselves, 'where do I want to be today, where do I want to be tomorrow, and where do I want to be in a hundred years?' We all have clear answers to those questions. We only have so much time. It's a real shame if we don't spend our lives trying to do that.;Jack Antonoff;age
My parents got married late and they had kids late, so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age.;Anna Kendrick;age
I'm a pretty big dork. It's crazy. I'm one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals, but I was right at that age where 'Rent' was a big deal for me and for my friends.;Anna Kendrick;age
My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug.

One already feels like an anachronism, writing novels in the age of what-ever-this-is-the-age-of, but touring to promote them feels doubly anachronistic. The marketplace is showing an increasing intolerance for the time-honored practice of printing information on paper and shipping it around the country.;Lev Grossman;age

I remember when I was 6 years old and my brother used to go seek out guys that were 13 to come over and play football against me while he was the 'permanent quarterback.' I didn't know exactly what the age difference was, but I was already playing against older guys.;Junior Seau;age

Everyone takes pause at 40. It's the age you have to assess everything in your life. It's the fictitious marker that's always coming up when you're young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40, and be successful by 40. Whatever success means.;Paul Feig;age
I started out modeling at a young age and surrounded myself with different brilliant minds. I have so many people to get educated from, and I've been a sponge.;Kellan Lutz;age

I never felt totally, 100%, patriotically English... I'd seen a lot of the world by an early age - sort of spent a lot of time traveling around Lebanon and I'd seen Babylon, and Damascus, and all sorts of places in the Middle East by the time I was ten. Then we'd return to Ruslip in West London... Done a fair bit of traveling really.;Andy Serkis;age

I've spent as much as 30 grand on a watch but it's not about flaunting my wealth. I don't have many extravagances but watches are my biggest one. I must have 30 of them now. I've been collecting since the age of nine, when I won a black TAG in a karting event.;Jenson Button;age
We were making the first step out of the age of chemistry and physics, and into the age of biology.;Jeremy Rifkin;age

The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.;Lascelles Abercrombie;age

All my early school reports from the age of 5 were 'Daniel must learn not to distract others.';Dan Stevens;age

I've always tried to do my very best, and I want to be the very best age, whatever age I am.;Ann-Margret;age

Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I've ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice. And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age.;John Legend;age
It's getting better generally, daily, especially in TV, for women in acting and age and looks count less. As more women come into the business. Change of any sort takes a long time to happen.;Julie Walters;age

I'm so secluded. Very alone.;Yves Saint Laurent;alone

The White House alone cannot hold its opponents accountable.;Paul Weyrich;alone
Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque.

See, the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary.

To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.;Le Corbusier;architecture

The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it's magical.;Maya Lin;architecture

I'm drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale.;Brad Pitt;architecture

I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.;Helmut Jahn;architecture

Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it's changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan.

To want friendship is a great fault. Friendship ought to be a gratuitous joy, like the joys afforded by art or life.;Simone Weil;art
Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism, you could remain nonverbal. You don't want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum.

Art is the objectification of feeling.;Herman Melville;art
There are worlds of experience beyond the world of the aggressive man, beyond history, and beyond science. The moods and qualities of nature and the revelations of great art are equally difficult to define we can grasp them only in the depths of our perceptive spirit.;Ansel Adams;art
The beginning of a friendship, the fact that two people out of the thousands around them can meet and connect and become friends, seems like a kind of magic to me. But maintaining a friendship requires work. I don't mean that as a bad thing. Good art requires work as well.;Charles de Lint;art
The sole art that suits me is that which, rising from unrest, tends toward serenity.;Andre Gide;art
Art is the collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better.;Andre Gide;art

I like it when somebody tells me a story, and I actually really feel that that's becoming like a lost art in American cinema.;Quentin Tarantino;art
There's a lot of thought in art. People get to talk about important things. There's a lot of sex, you know, in art. There's a lot of naked women and men, and there's intrigue, there's fakery. It's a real microcosm of the larger world.;Steve Martin;art
You want to be a bit compulsive in your art or craft or whatever you do.;Steve Martin;art
I'm enamored with the art world. Anytime you look at anything that's considered artistic, there's a commercial world around it: the ballet, opera, any kind of music. It can't exist without it.;Steve Martin;art

What is art? Prostitution.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.;Edgar Degas;art
Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.;Paul Rand;art
I don't have anything to say about other people's art and their work.;Dolly Parton;art
Patience is the art of concealing your impatience.;Guy Kawasaki;art

For his heart was in his work, and the heart giveth grace unto every art.;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow;art
Resolve and thou art free.;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow;art

I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few.;William Morris;art

Egotism: The art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see.;George V. Higgins;art
A work of art has no importance whatever to society. It is only important to the individual.;Vladimir Nabokov;art
I don't think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today. But it's certainly worth a try.;Steven Spielberg;art
I think that one's art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows.;Emily Carr;art
It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.;W. H. Auden;art
After a few months in my parents' basement, I took an apartment near the state university, where I discovered both crystal methamphetamine and conceptual art. Either one of these things are dangerous, but in combination they have the potential to destroy entire civilizations.;David Sedaris;art
To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living.;Herman Melville;art
I had wanted a tape recorder since I was tiny. I thought it was a magic thing. I never got one until just before I went to art school.;Brian Eno;art

Art is anything you can get away with.;Marshall McLuhan;art
Everything a writer learns about the art or craft of fiction takes just a little away from his need or desire to write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to say.;Raymond Chandler;art
Nature scarcely ever gives us the very best for that we must have recourse to art.;Baltasar Gracian;art
To say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of diplomacy.;Will Durant;art
Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
Oh literature, oh the glorious Art, how it preys upon the marrow in our bones. It scoops the stuffing out of us, and chucks us aside. Alas!;David Herbert Lawrence;art
Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art
In its most limited sense, modern, art would seem to concern itself only with the technical innovations of the period.;Edward Hopper;art
The question of the value of nationality in art is perhaps unsolvable.;Edward Hopper;art
The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.;Edward Hopper;art
Life is short, the art long.;Hippocrates;art
Everything that has ever been called folk art has always reflected domination.;Theodor Adorno;art
Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.;Charlie Parker;art
My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I've been pursuing all my life.;Paul Cezanne;art
Don't be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation.;Paul Cezanne;art
Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does.;Walter Murch;art
Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man's starving!;O. Henry;art
It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.;Ezra Pound;art
It is not in life, but in art that self-fulfillment is to be found.;Wilson Mizner;art
Art lies by its own artifice.;Ovid;art
Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.;Publilius Syrus;art
Art and works of art do not make an artist sense and enthusiasm and instinct do.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
You can't but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it's a narrative art form.;Tom Stoppard;art
Teachers believe they have a gift for giving it drives them with the same irrepressible drive that drives others to create a work of art or a market or a building.;A. Bartlett Giamatti;art
The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art.;John Lasseter;art
To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is, intimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infinite, expressed by every means available to the arts.;Charles Baudelaire;art
What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.;Michel Foucault;art
Art is so subjective, and people can react however they want.;Jennifer Aniston;art
I'm free. I just do what I want, say what I want, say how I feel, and I don't try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don't compromise my art in any kind of way, and I think people respect that.;Erykah Badu;art
Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I've heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast.;Jerry Saltz;art
To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.;Jerry Saltz;art
Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.;Jerry Saltz;art
I can't bear art that you can walk round and admire. A book should be either a bandit or a rebel or a man in the crowd.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
Since obscenity is the truth of our passion today, it is the only stuff of art - or almost the only stuff.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
The essential function of art is moral. But a passionate, implicit morality, not didactic. A morality which changes the blood, rather than the mind.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
I am more a friend of art than a producer of painting.;Paul Cezanne;art
You say a new era in art is preparing you sensed it coming continue your studies without weakening. God will do the rest.;Paul Cezanne;art
I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain.;Paul Cezanne;art
Is art really the priesthood that demands the pure in heart who belong to it wholly?;Paul Cezanne;art
A frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Evil is done without effort, naturally, it is the working of fate good is always the product of an art.;Charles Baudelaire;art
I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.;Sydney Pollack;art
The art of living is the art of knowing how to believe lies.;Cesare Pavese;art
Let's talk of a system that transforms all the social organisms into a work of art, in which the entire process of work is included... something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It's a Gigantic project.;Joseph Beuys;art
Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience.;Rebecca West;art
History repeats itself, but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird.;Joseph Conrad;art
One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on.;Danica McKellar;art
A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.;Clive Bell;art
It was Public Art, defined as art that is purchased by experts who are not spending their own personal money.;Dave Barry;art
Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved.;Isadora Duncan;art
Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art.;William Bernbach;art
I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.';Lady Gaga;art
Medicine is not only a science it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.;Paracelsus;art
I would no more quarrel with a man because of his religion than I would because of his art.;Mary Baker Eddy;art
So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die that is to say, civilization will die.;William Morris;art
Poor Georgia O'Keeffe. Death didn't soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings.;Jerry Saltz;art
I've always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Megacollectors suppose they can enter art history by spending astronomical amounts.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art gods cooked up something special for James Ensor.;Jerry Saltz;art
All art comes from other art, and all immigrants come from other places.;Jerry Saltz;art
When art wins, everyone wins.;Jerry Saltz;art
I have a soft spot for art that, in terms of subject matter and material, is in bad taste.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is changing. Again. Here. Now. Opportunities to witness this are rare, so attend and observe.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is good, bad, boring, ugly, useful to us or not.;Jerry Saltz;art
Recessions are hard on people, but they are not hard on art.;Jerry Saltz;art
I like that the art world isn't regulated.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art world is molting - some would say melting. Galleries are closing museums are scaling back.;Jerry Saltz;art
Almost all institutions own a lot more art than they can ever show, much of it revealing for its timeliness, genius, or sheer weirdness.;Jerry Saltz;art
The forties, seventies, and the nineties, when money was scarce, were great periods, when the art world retracted but it was also reborn.;Jerry Saltz;art
Robert Rauschenberg was not a giant of American art he was the giant. No American created so many aesthetic openings for so many artists.;Jerry Saltz;art
The Met is not only the finest encyclopedic museum of art in the United States it is arguably the finest anywhere.;Jerry Saltz;art
Money is something that can be measured art is not. It's all subjective.;Jerry Saltz;art
Contrary to popular opinion, things don't go stale particularly fast in the art world.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art usually only makes the news in America when the subject is money.;Jerry Saltz;art
I hate art auctions.;Jerry Saltz;art
The price of a work of art has nothing to do with what the work of art is, can do, or is worth on an existential, alchemical level.;Jerry Saltz;art
To me, nothing in the art world is neutral. The idea of 'disinterest' strikes me as boring, dishonest, dubious, and uninteresting.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art world is an all-volunteer force. No one has to be here if he or she doesn't want to be, and we should be associating with anyone we want to.;Jerry Saltz;art
Wolfgang Tillman's stunning large-scale pictures, being shown for the first time, were so offhand I failed to see them as art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.;Jerry Saltz;art
There's something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.;Jerry Saltz;art
First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.;Jerry Saltz;art
Not to say people shouldn't get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.;Jerry Saltz;art
These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I'm a flesh-eating virus.;Jerry Saltz;art
In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don't know what we're seeing, we overreact.;Jerry Saltz;art
Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.;Jerry Saltz;art
Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There's likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam's or Hamburg's galleries.;Jerry Saltz;art
Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn't any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.;Jerry Saltz;art
Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.;Jerry Saltz;art
Imagine it's 1981. You're an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You're also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn't that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.;Jerry Saltz;art
Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.;Jerry Saltz;art
I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn's work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn't simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved 'isms' and twists.;Jerry Saltz;art
It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He's the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.;Jerry Saltz;art
The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city's magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.;Jerry Saltz;art
Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you'll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).;Jerry Saltz;art
My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.;Jerry Saltz;art
I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York,' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.;Jerry Saltz;art
Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.;Jerry Saltz;art
It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn't own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.;Jerry Saltz;art
All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.;Jerry Saltz;art
Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.;Jerry Saltz;art
Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you'll find it. It's there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.;Jerry Saltz;art
After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it's now close to aesthetic kudzu.;Jerry Saltz;art
The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we're not pure enough, good omens appear.;Jerry Saltz;art
Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don't seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist's work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there's something wrong with the art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.;Jerry Saltz;art
It's great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.;Jerry Saltz;art
The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer's journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It's not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.;Jerry Saltz;art
It's art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn't about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - 'contain multitudes.';Jerry Saltz;art
The last time money left the art world, intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries, and a few of them have become the best in the world.;Jerry Saltz;art
Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.;Jerry Saltz;art
While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It's a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.;Jerry Saltz;art
When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.' All this flashy 'art-fair art' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.;Jerry Saltz;art
A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.;Jerry Saltz;art
Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.;Jerry Saltz;art
If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.;Jerry Saltz;art
A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.;Jerry Saltz;art
It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.;Jerry Saltz;art
'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art
Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art
A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art
The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art
Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art
Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art
'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art
Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art
Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art
The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art
Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art
Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art
Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art
Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art
If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art
I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art
A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art
I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art
I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art
When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art
I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art
Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art
Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art
Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art
We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art
I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art
To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art
Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art
Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art
Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art
Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art
Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art
What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art
Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art
Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art
Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art
As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art
The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art
Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art
You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art
With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art
Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art
Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art
I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art
Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art
Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art
Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art
I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art
A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art
It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art
Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art
Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art
I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art
Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art
In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art
In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art
Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art
Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art
The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art
I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art
Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art
Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art
Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art
Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art
Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art
Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art
Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art
Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art
Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art
To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art
I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art
I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art
A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art
Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art
I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art
Piano playing is a dying art. I love the fact that I can be one guy with one instrument evoking an emotional and musical experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;art
I don't believe in art. I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art
Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art
Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art
People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it's simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art
There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art
The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art
The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn't make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art
I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art
The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art
Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it's well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art
Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art
It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Art is not living. It is the use of living.;Audre Lorde;art
The work of art is a scream of freedom.;Christo;art
The body is your instrument in dance, but your art is outside that creature, the body.;Martha Graham;art
Art is contemplation. It is the pleasure of the mind which searches into nature and which there divines the spirit of which nature herself is animated.;Auguste Rodin;art
Education is the art of making man ethical.;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel;art
The art of mastering life is the prerequisite for all further forms of expression, whether they are paintings, sculptures, tragedies, or musical compositions.;Paul Klee;art
I like science and I love gym. Oh, and I like art, but I'm really bad at it. I'm just a terrible drawer. I can't draw a circle. Even with a ruler, I can't draw a straight line.;Daniel Radcliffe;art
Modesty: the gentle art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it.;Oliver Herford;art
I don't watch television, I think it destroys the art of talking about oneself.;Stephen Fry;art
Great art speaks a language which every intelligent person can understand. The people who call themselves modernists today speak a different language.;Marshall McLuhan;art
All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art
The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art
My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art
A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art
Film in the 20th century, it's the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art
Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art
I don't think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art
I don't think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further. It celebrates humanity instead of manipulating it.;Keith Haring;art
Let us be true: this is the highest maxim of art and of life, the secret of eloquence and of virtue, and of all moral authority.;Henri Frederic Amiel;art
History has remembered the kings and warriors, because they destroyed art has remembered the people, because they created.;William Morris;art
I just wish the crowd I was associated with was more passionate about what they were doing and less consumed with the commerce of the art form.;Shia LaBeouf;art
Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn.;Norman McLaren;art
The reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication: that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up.;Jean Cocteau;art
At the beginning of the 20th century, the ambition of the great painters was to make paintings that were like music, which was then considered as the noblest art.;Brian Eno;art
The smart thing in the art world is to have one good idea and never have another.;Brian Eno;art
The prerequisite of originality is the art of forgetting, at the proper moment, what we know.;Arthur Koestler;art
One of the things you're doing when you make art, apart from entertaining yourself and other people, is trying to see what ways of working feel good, what feels right.;Brian Eno;art
Art is Art. Everything else is everything else.;Ad Reinhardt;art

Reason clears and plants the wilderness of the imagination to harvest the wheat of art.;Austin O'Malley;art
Censorship is to art as lynching is to justice.;Henry Louis Gates;art
The art world can be very intimidating because it's just so vast. You talk to people who are really clued in to all the young artists and coming into it you're never going to be able to catch up immediately, even though there's pressure to.;Daniel Radcliffe;art
I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art
There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.;Jim Davis;art
Art is the most passionate orgy within man's grasp.;John Donne;art
Smiles come naturally to me, but I started thinking of them as an art form at my command. I studied all the time. I looked at magazines, I'd practice in front of the mirror and I'd ask photographers about the best angles. I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art
Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art
It's an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.;Robert Redford;art
I'm not interested in pop art.;Billy Corgan;art
Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art
An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.;Alvar Aalto;art
As I grew older, I realized that it was much better to insist on the genuine forms of nature, for simplicity is the greatest adornment of art.;Albrecht Durer;art
I think of art, at its most significant, as a DEW line, a Distant Early Warning system that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it.;Marshall McLuhan;art
I'd love to go to art school. I'd love to learn how to draw. I'd love to be fluent in Spanish. I'd like to be a brain surgeon.;Billie Joe Armstrong;art
People of art should never get married and have children, because it's a selfish experience.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;art
It has always been difficult for Man to realize that his life is all an art. It has been more difficult to conceive it so than to act it so. For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art
Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art
Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art
Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.;Camille Paglia;art
And I have exposed myself to art so that my work has something beyond just the usual potter.;Beatrice Wood;art
Originality is the art of concealing your source.;Franklin P. Jones;art

When hospitality becomes an art it loses its very soul.;Max Beerbohm;art
A verbal art like poetry is reflective it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.;W. H. Auden;art
It's a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.;W. H. Auden;art
Art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.;W. H. Auden;art
The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art
I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art
All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art
In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art
To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.;Henri Frederic Amiel;art
In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.';Kristin Scott Thomas;art
Another unsettling element in modern art is that common symptom of immaturity, the dread of doing what has been done before.;Edith Wharton;art
Art is the signature of civilizations.;Beverly Sills;art
Although all the good arts serve to draw man's mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure.;Nicolaus Copernicus;art
The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.;Arthur Erickson;art

I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That's art to me.;Maya Lin;art
Translation is the art of failure.;Umberto Eco;art
Life is very nice, but it lacks form. It's the aim of art to give it some.;Jean Anouilh;art
I'm very happy to hear that my work inspires writers and painters. It's the most beautiful compliment, the greatest reward. Art should always be an exchange.;Nick Cave;art
Literature is the art of discovering something extraordinary about ordinary people, and saying with ordinary words something extraordinary.;Boris Pasternak;art
Raising children is a creative endeavor, an art rather than a science.;Bruno Bettelheim;art

One of the main reasons I am so drawn to Hitchcock is that he planned his shots way in advance on story-boards, which he designed like classic paintings (he was an art connoisseur). It's why he found shooting on set boring - because he had already composed the film in his head.;Camille Paglia;art
Madonna remains the most visible performer on the planet, as well as one of the wealthiest, but would anyone seriously say that artistic self-development is her primary motivating principle?

That's exactly what I should be doing.;Paul Ryan;attitude
I developed a nutty attitude where I'd think, If some guy really loves me he doesn't care if I'm fat. I'd come up with all these stupid reasons why it would be OK to be fat.;Kirstie Alley;attitude

Punk was defined by an attitude rather than a musical style.;David Byrne;attitude
It's a fundamental, social attitude that the 1% supports symphonies and operas and doesn't support Johnny learning to program hip-hop beats.

On 'Van Halen,' I was a young punk, and everything revolved around the fastest kid in town, gunslinger attitude. But I'd say that at the time of 'Fair Warning,' I started concentrating more on songwriting. But I guess in most people's minds I'm just a gunslinger.;Eddie Van Halen;attitude

The attitude that nature is chaotic and that the artist puts order into it is a very absurd point of view, I think. All that we can hope for is to put some order into ourselves.;Willem de Kooning;attitude

I went to England in the '70s, and I was in my early 20s. There was still a residue of that era of being an underclass or colonial.

We were a country full of sheep and convicts.;Geoffrey Rush;attitude
For a writer only one form of patriotism exists: his attitude toward language.;Joseph Brodsky;attitude
Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is, closely examine why you feel that way.

I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school.

Films for TV have to be much closer to the book, mainly because the objective with a TV movie that translates literature is to get the audience, after seeing this version, to pick up the book and read it themselves.

You can't beat the beehive for glam punkette attitude.;Rob Sheffield;attitude

I love her attitude, but as much as I'd like to bring my medals to a speech or appearance, I never do.;Mary Lou Retton;attitude

I have played on many teams throughout my career, and I know when a team has the tools, and the right positive attitude towards winning.;Boomer Esiason;attitude
Vampires are so old that they don't need to impress anyone anymore. They're comfortable in their own skin. It's this enigmatic strength that's very romantic and old-fashioned.

I'm just part of a tradition of people who aren't pleased. I would never think anyone else who has the same attitude was getting it from me. I'd just think they're... sensible.;Jack Dee;attitude

What a stupid attitude we have in this country to personal stories.;Amanda Burton;attitude

Sid Vicious began the age of participation in which everyone could be the artist. Sid proved that you don't have to play well to be the star. You can play badly, or not even at all.

You'd like more people to recognise what you do is special. But I take the attitude that the best thing I can do for my sport is to be the best at it.

I still have a young attitude.;Pat Morita;attitude

Shame, like beauty, is often in the eye of the beholder.;Julie Burchill;beauty
The truth of the matter is, beauty is a specific thing, rare and fleeting. Some of us have it in our teens, 20s and 30s and then lose it most of us have it not at all. And that's perfectly okay. But lying to yourself that you have it when you don't seems to me simple-minded at best and psychotic at worst.;Julie Burchill;beauty

Surely being a Professional Beauty - let alone an ageing one - is one of the most insecure and doomed careers imaginable.;Julie Burchill;beauty

Hollywood needs to recognise all shades of African American beauty.;Gabrielle Union;beauty

Beauty is a radiance that originates from within and comes from inner security and strong character.;Jane Seymour;beauty

Thanks to capitalism, the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated.

A supermodel needed to be able to be on 'Sports Illustrated,' to be able to walk runways, to be able to do beauty ads, to be on covers.

I mean the beauty of being a writer is it's not like being a swimmer. When they were talking about our Olympic swimmers and they'd say, 'Oh she's so old,' and she's all of 25 or something.

Music, as many people have said, is the universal language. Of course points are made which make you think about things, but ultimately it makes you feel.

Music, art, theater. I'm just a big fan of beauty.;Jerry Hall;beauty

I remember reminding myself that beauty is an opinion, not a fact. And it has always made me feel better.;Hayden Panettiere;beauty

I recognize in thieves, traitors and murderers, in the ruthless and the cunning, a deep beauty - a sunken beauty.;Jean Genet;beauty
As a mom, I don't have much time for beauty.;Idina Menzel;beauty
The pattern of a newspaperman's life is like the plot of 'Black Beauty.'

J. Liebling;beauty

I just thought, 'What?';Christina Hendricks;birthday

And in Hollywood, as in any business, the calls stop coming when you don't answer.;Arsenio Hall;business

Perhaps the most effective way to describe the approach a brand must take is to think of themselves as social cartographers. By that I mean that brands must simultaneously inspire, engage and maintain a series of conversations taking place within certain cultural landscape specific to their business goal.;Simon Mainwaring;business
The social business marketplace is effectively forcing brands to engage with consumers on the basis of something that is meaningful to them. More often than not, this takes the form of some core value that finds expression in a non-profit cause.;Simon Mainwaring;business
Integrate purpose into your for-profit business model through a long term commitment to a cause that is aligned with your core values and those of your community.;Simon Mainwaring;business
In today's social business marketplace Facebook is one of the best places for nonprofits to be discovered and connect with a larger audience on the basis of shared values.

In the social business marketplace, brands that hope to build loyal and growing communities do so most effectively when they demonstrate their core values and allow a community to build and engage around it.;Simon Mainwaring;business

Somebody has to tell the E.P.A. that we don't need you monkeying around and fiddling around and getting in our business with every kind of regulation you can dream up. You're doing nothing more than killing jobs. It's a cemetery for jobs at the E.P.A.;Rick Perry;business

I'm very free-spirited and crazy. I love to have fun, and I like doing stupid things. At the same time, I'm like a 35-year-old. I have a house. I have a car. I have a steady job. I have a business, and I have to make serious decisions.;Avril Lavigne;business

I have laid aside business, and gone a'fishing.;Izaak Walton;business
Understand why casinos and racetracks stay in business - the gambler always loses over the long term.;Marilyn vos Savant;business

I couldn't be an ingenue today, because the business has changed. I remember when you could dress for a premiere just by putting on a cute top. Now you have to be perfect and fabulous in every way, or you're ridiculed.;Julia Roberts;business

The 9-9-9 plan would resuscitate this economy because it replaces the outdated tax code that allows politicians to pick winners and losers, and to provide favors in the form of tax breaks, special exemptions and loopholes. It simplifies the code dramatically: 9% business flat tax, 9% personal flat tax, 9% sales tax.;Herman Cain;business
I don't have more money. I won't have more money than any of the candidates, even the Republican candidates. We know that already. But we are building this campaign team like I would build a business. And that is, we are building it so far with no debt.;Herman Cain;business
Whether you were talking about Pillsbury, Burger King, Godfather's, the National Restaurant Association, in each one of those situations, I had a daunting problem that I had to solve.

My approach to cutting spending as president, is to do a ten percent across the board cut of all federal agencies, and then ask each of my new agency heads to find another ten percent by drilling down.

Half the time men think they are talking business, they are wasting time.;E. W. Howe;business
I've seen so many people in this business that made a fortune. They get old and broke and can't make any money. I tell you something... no one's going to play a benefit for Jimmy Dean.;Jimmy Dean;business
I do not understand how it is that financial institutions could think that they could take taxpayer money and then turn around and act like it's business as usual.

There's no business like show business, but there are several businesses like accounting.;David Letterman;business

The camera fails to capture the 'business' in show business! We typically will give 10 percent of our salary to the agent, 10 percent to the manager, and 5 percent to the lawyer, plus the publicist gets a flat fee, which needs to be budgeted for.;Danica McKellar;business
The movie business is a big gamble.;Jackie Chan;business

Newspapers with declining circulations can complain all they want about their readers and even say they have no taste. But you will still go out of business over time. A newspaper is not a public trust - it has a business model that either works or it doesn't.;Marc Andreessen;business
I want to go out at the top, but the secret is knowing when you're at the top, it's so difficult in this business, your career fluctuates all the time, up and down, like a pair of trousers.;Rod Stewart;business
You shouldn't be in the music business if you're posing.;Rod Stewart;business

I learned you have to fight for yourself in the picture business.;Loretta Young;business
As an actress, emotions are my business, my stock-in-trade. As such, I've dealt with them nearly all my life.;Loretta Young;business
I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves, and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can, it's so unnatural for me to do it on television, in interviews, in anything like that. I also don't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else's business.;Kristen Stewart;business
A business like an automobile, has to be driven, in order to get results.;B. C. Forbes;business

In America, we no longer have an institutionalized, organized way of calling business to task - of taking them to account for what they've done - and this is especially true in the cultural realm.;Thomas Frank;business
Selling public property is the true Chicago way. Had Mr. Obama not been elected president, the nation's business journals would be falling over one another to praise his city for its daring, market-friendly innovations.;Thomas Frank;business
As you watch the world crumble, try taking your Armageddon with this sprinkling of irony: Over the last three decades, business has got virtually everything it wanted, and its doomsday scenario from the 1970s has come true because of it.;Thomas Frank;business

Do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money? It would be hard to say that they do. Indeed, many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between self-interest and the interests of all.;Peter Singer;business
I think in politics, in Congress, you often do things that are Republican, or you do things because you're a Democrat. Sometimes that's good, obviously, and sometimes that's obviously bad. But in the news business, there's no such thing as Republican or Democratic news. News is news.;J. C. Watts;business
I have watched people who have nothing to do with the film business, but who have become part of the circle for a short period of time. They can be truly devastated when the film wraps and people leave.;Jacqueline Bisset;business
This film business, perhaps more so in America than in Europe, has always been about young sexuality. It's not true of theatre, but in America, film audiences are young. It's not an intellectual cinema in America.;Jacqueline Bisset;business

It's not hard to get your way when it's your way or the highway. People either follow suit or they're not around. I don't really like the sound of that, 'cause that sounds like a temper tantrum.

Politicians also have a love affair with the 'small business exemption.' Too much paperwork? Too heavy a burden? Not enough time? Just exempt small businesses from the rule. It sounds so pro-growth. Instead it's an admission that the costs of a regulation just can't be justified.;John Sununu;business
Today I can announce a raft of reforms that we estimate could save over 2.5 million police hours every year. That's the equivalent of more than 1,200 police officer posts. These reforms are a watershed moment in policing. They show that we really mean business in busting bureaucracy.;Theresa May;business
I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here. I came into this business almost by accident, but now it has become serious.

I have no business being a journalist. I'm the least, I'm the least - I'm the most trusting, I absolutely make a habit of believing anything that anybody tells me about themselves.

But that's show business.;Christopher Walken;business
There is the expression of selfishness and there is the expression of selflessness - but economists or theoreticians never touched that part. They said: 'Go and become a philanthropist.'

I stayed in show business to pay for my animal business.;Betty White;business
I always wanted to be a zookeeper when I was growing up, and I've wound up a zookeeper! I've been working with the Los Angeles Zoo for 45 years!

You can't ask for better than two things you love the most.;Betty White;business
I am interested in a lot of things - not just show business and my passion for animals. I try to keep current in what's going on in the world. I do mental exercises.

Rock stars get room keys, I get business cards.;Thomas Friedman;business
The people who are competing business-wise out there want what other successful labels and artists have. I don't want what they have I want my own path, my own sound, my own identity. Record labels care nothing about identity or artistic freedom, they want good business.;Joe Nichols;business

I do not want to admit to the world that I can be a bad person. It is just that I don't want anyone to have false expectations.

And then I had to run like hell to catch up with my own image.;Barbara Corcoran;business
My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could.

It's a libel to say that I use my newspapers to support my other business interests. The fact is, I haven't got any other business interests.;Rupert Murdoch;business

People are always saying that Hollywood messes up kids. I'm like, 'No, families mess up kids!' I grew up in Hollywood, and I'm perfectly fine. If my children want to go into the entertainment business, I won't stop them, as long as they're passionate about it.;Tori Spelling;business
The Internet creates as well as destroys. Social networks, search advertising, and cloud computing are multibillion dollar industries that didn't exist 10 years ago. They are products of the same force that has rendered the Postal Service's core business obsolete.;John Sununu;business
If you create something that is asking for people to respond as they're going to respond, you have to allow them to respond as they're going to respond. Some of the people are going to be uninterested and some people are going to be mad for some reason, which is their business. That's just the way the world is.;Charlie Kaufman;business
Energy and environmental regulation, transportation, and broadband policy all benefit when legislators have a basic grounding in the technical concepts behind business models, products, and innovation.;John Sununu;business
If you say, 'I'm going to cut this song because I know the teenagers are going to love it,' well, then you're going to alienate everybody else. When I cut my record, I'm just going to cut the things that I like, and whoever likes it, likes it. That's too much work to try to figure out the demographic. That's too much like a business.;Jason Aldean;business
Barack Obama's life was so much simpler in 2009. Back then, he had refined the cold act of blaming others for the bad economy into an art form. Deficits? Blame Bush's tax cuts. Spending? Blame the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No business investment? Blame Wall Street.;John Sununu;business
In the music business, especially the country music business, every 10 years or so you're going to have this changing of the guard, this wave of new artists that comes in.;Jason Aldean;business

I'd like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.;Caroline Wozniacki;business

Our marriage is between us. If we decide to continue being together or not, it's our business.;Gwyneth Paltrow;business
The movie business is very difficult but the music business is just impossible.

Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.;Richard Dawkins;car
To attract men, I wear a perfume called 'New Car Interior.';Rita Rudner;car
I am thankful the most important key in history was invented. It's not the key to your house, your car, your boat, your safety deposit box, your bike lock or your private community. It's the key to order, sanity, and peace of mind. The key is 'Delete.';Elayne Boosler;car
American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car, they calculate everything: the speed, the distance... But in Hong Kong, we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts, you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.;Jackie Chan;car
It seems to me I spent my life in car pools, but you know, that's how I kept track of what was going on.;Barbara Bush;car
Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than going to the garage makes you a car.;Laurence J. Peter;car

I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.;Kim Kardashian;car
White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.;Kim Kardashian;car
My brother was a lifeguard in a car wash.;Henny Youngman;car
I think a lot of writers, male and female, write as if their parents were killed in a car accident when they were 2, and they have no one to hold accountable. And unfortunately, I don't have that. I have parents who I care about what they think.;Mindy Kaling;car
I'm gonna be making records anyway, even if I had to sell 'em out of the trunk of my car. I'm that kind of musician and singer.;Dolly Parton;car
Why do people talk of the horrors of old age? It's great. I feel like a fine old car with the parts gradually wearing out, but I'm not complaining,... Those who find growing old terrible are people who haven't done what they wanted with their lives.;Martha Gellhorn;car

I don't want to argue with my wife about her car - or my driving.;Dale Earnhardt;car
People and squirrels are very different. Most people will not argue that. But I find that there is one situation in which they're very similar. And that is: when I am driving towards them in my car. Then they're kind of hard to tell apart - especially if the human is kind of hairy.;Demetri Martin;car

I race to win. If I am on the bike or in a car it will always be the same.;Valentino Rossi;car
As soon as I get my car I think I'll be going to the cinema more. Since I don't go very often, there are no films that are a must see at the moment. I usually wait till they come out on DVD.;Tom Felton;car
It's shocking to say, but the cinema is quite a while away from me, and I haven't got a car yet.;Tom Felton;car

I couldn't find the sports car of my dreams, so I built it myself.;Ferdinand Porsche;car

I've spent more on my Dodger tickets that I did on my car.;Shia LaBeouf;car
My first car, I got it in an auction at my temple. It was an '86 Volvo that I got for 500 bucks, and then wound up throwing $10,000 into the stereo system and put TVs in the foot rests. It was the most ridiculous Volvo you'd ever seen, but I had never had money before and I was out of my mind.;Shia LaBeouf;car

My parents were what I like to call proper musical fans. Lots of Sondheim was played in the car.;Daniel Radcliffe;car
I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car.;Daniel Radcliffe;car
People who have car collections - I never understood that. I always thought that was unnecessary. It's not beautiful, it's not creative. It's just showing how much money you've got.;Daniel Radcliffe;car
My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost.;Richard Branson;car

I want to let my friend Buster know that I would like to have dinner with him tonight. Does Buster work at home? Then how likely is he to have his cell phone on? Is he one of those people who only turns on his cell when he's in his car? I hate that.;Susan Orlean;car
Having played many roles of scientific intellect I do have an empathy for that world. It's been hard on me because flying the Enterprise for seven years in Star Trek and sitting in Cerebro in X-men has led people to believe that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm still trying to work out how to operate the air conditioning unit on my car.;Patrick Stewart;car
I never listen to the radio unless I rent a car.;David Byrne;car
You can know or not know how a car runs and still enjoy riding in a car.;David Byrne;car
I don't listen to the radio very much, but that could be because I don't have a car.;David Byrne;car
There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left, you can veer off there, which isn't so easy in a car, and you can't cover as much ground walking.;David Byrne;car
I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me!;Richard Pryor;car

I like the desert for short periods of time, from inside a car, with the windows rolled up, and the doors locked. I prefer beach resorts with room service.;Anne Lamott;car
I recorded a song called, I Fall to Pieces, and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm worried because I have a brand-new record, and it's called Crazy!;Patsy Cline;car
My grandma's the most careful, safe driver in the world. You put her in a rental car, and she's doing doughnuts in the K-Mart parking lot!;Jeff Foxworthy;car
I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that's why they're so relatable.;Bono;car
I have a car but it's not important.;Eric Cantona;car

I was hit by a car once on my bike, but I still rode home.;Amy Winehouse;car
Fact: The new '90210' is cooler than the old '90210.' It's the lithe, streamlined Skipper to the elder series' venerable Barbie. Gone are the traditional parents - they've been replaced by a hipster mom n' pop who get busted necking in the car.;Diablo Cody;car
The world is full of abundance and opportunity, but far too many people come to the fountain of life with a sieve instead of a tank car... a teaspoon instead of a steam shovel. They expect little and as a result they get little.;Ben Sweetland;car

Ten to 20 years out, driving your car will be viewed as equivalently immoral as smoking cigarettes around other people is today.;Marc Andreessen;car
I look away at car crashes, and I know people who look away at car crashes, because it makes us uncomfortable to watch other people in pain.;John Mayer;car
I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that.;Evel Knievel;car
And that just shows you how important the car is in Formula One Racing.;Murray Walker;car
I love sleeping in a moving car more than sleeping in bed.;Ben Stein;car

Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.;Al Gore;car
Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day.;Billy Connolly;car
There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.;Leon Trotsky;car
Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up it is culture and identity. Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car.;Jonathan Safran Foer;car

Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work, driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for, in order to get to a job that you need so you can pay for the clothes, car and the house that you leave empty all day in order to afford to live in it.;Ellen Goodman;car
The irony is that it was tougher to rent a car from Cerberus when it owned Alamo than to buy a semi-automatic. To rent a car, one had to provide ID, a drivers' license, and get insurance coverage. To buy a gun? Cash and carry, from the back of a station wagon at a gun show. No concerns about downstream liability or risk.;Eliot Spitzer;car
At least 50 times. I've jumped off a building, jumped off a cliff in a car. I've been in bedrooms when women came in with knives and guns.;Dennis Rodman;car
Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?;Jason Reitman;car
The American Dream has run out of gas. The car has stopped. It no longer supplies the world with its images, its dreams, its fantasies. No more. It's over. It supplies the world with its nightmares now: the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, Vietnam.;J. G. Ballard;car
You know what I really love? The CD players in a car. How when you put the CD right up by the slot, it actually takes it out of your hand, like it's hungry. It pulls it in, and you feel like it wants more silver discs.;Tom Waits;car
My mother gave me this book called Feature Films at Used Car Prices by a guy named Rick Schmidt. I gotta credit the guy, cuz he gave me the most practical advice. It empowers you.;Vin Diesel;car

My definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car.;Larry Hagman;car

A critic is a man who knows the way but can't drive the car.;Kenneth Tynan;car

The bass player's function, along with the drums, is to be the engine that drives the car... everything else is merely colours.;Suzi Quatro;car
Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad. Spending $19,000 for a small family car would feel, well, more or less right. But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.;Jeffrey Kluger;car
I think I'm actually quite a materialistic person, I value what it takes to make a car or build a nice house. Money does change things, but how it changes people depends on how they react to it.;Roland Gift;car

I've always been a bit of a car freak.;Eric Bana;car
Over my lifetime, the car had actually transcended the fact that it is a car. It has become a venue.;Eric Bana;car

I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.;Rowan Atkinson;car

When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music. He'd turn down the music and turn around and I'd be singing and know all of the words but I didn't even know how to talk. From then on I've always wanted to be a singer.;Leona Lewis;car

Okay, let's talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It's, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it's actually a solid wine.;Gary Vaynerchuk;car

That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.;Patti Stanger;car
I'm lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that's important because I want to know that I don't have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don't want to and that I'll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.;Ashley Greene;car

I mean, you've kind of got the track down, especially with ovals. The only thing that improves is that when race conditions come, you know what to expect slightly more from the track and from your car.;Danica Patrick;car
I think that Indy is special to me. The greater the distance between the last time I drove an Indy car and the next time, I wouldn't like that to be too big.;Danica Patrick;car
On Memorial Day, I was out floating on Lake Norman and came across Denny Hamlin. We struck up a conversation, and one of the first things we were talking about was how much it helped him when he started racing the Cup car and how much it helped his Nationwide program.;Danica Patrick;car
Every time I get into a Nationwide car after being in a Cup car, I feel so much more comfortable than I did previously.;Danica Patrick;car
No matter how good you are, how brave you are or anything, it comes down to that car so many times. Not every time, but so many times.;Danica Patrick;car
I'm a big believer in everybody being themselves. If not doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, that's great. But if doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, then you should be able to do it. What I do outside the car adds to who I am and expresses a different side of me.;Danica Patrick;car
I think women like Ferraris. A Ferrari is everybody's car.;Tim Allen;car
Freedom is not an ideal, it is not even a protection, if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate, to live without dreams, to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set.;Adlai Stevenson;car
I started rapping before anybody had ever bought a car from it. It was truly about the art form and the culture, more so than now, where it's a successful way to make money. Back then you had to be doing it because you liked it.;Ice T;car
Austin sounds a little bit like Aston Martin, which is the type of car James Bond would drive.;Mike Myers;car
Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we've all been heavily sedated from it. If we don't come into consciousness of this tragedy, there's going to be a violent awakening we don't want. The question is, can we wake up?;Anna Deavere Smith;car
It was my father who instilled the 'never say no' attitude I carry around with me today, and who instilled in me a sense of wonder, always taking us on adventures in the car, never telling us the destination.;Marlee Matlin;car
I did this Super-8 film at art school called 'Tissues,' this black comedy about a family whose father has been arrested for child molestation. I was absolutely thrilled by every inch of it, and would throw my projector in the back of my car and show it to anybody who would watch it.;Jane Campion;car
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?;James Hillman;car
By the time the children go to bed, I am as drained as any mother who has spent her day working, car pooling, building Lego castles and shopping for the precisely correct soccer cleat.;Ayelet Waldman;car
I think we've been dulled by capitalism. We're just blobs now - we're so worried about how we can keep paying the lease on the car, the mortgage, the lease on the toaster and all that. You can't really think about much else. If you lose that, you lose the whole lot.;Rupert Everett;car
Before now, I've always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot. I still do that, but more so now I'm listening to it on the Beat box, and I think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is.;Dr. Dre;car
I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street, stay on the right side, no hitting the car, go in right, you'll see a big church, stop and take a left, and you'll have it. By doing this I'm giving a structure of life, a path of light, and showing what happens between me and me, which is something very beautiful.;Jean Claude Van Damme;car
I'd kind of like to have a classic old muscle car. I think that would be fun.;Brooke Burke;car
Once I accepted Christ I immediately had peace. I still didn't have a place to live, I still didn't have a car, but I had peace.;Sherri Shepherd;car
When I was a kid I got busted for throwing a rock through a car window and egging a house on halloween.;Gavin DeGraw;car
Sometimes movie-making happens like clockwork other times, like a car accident.;Eric Roberts;car
I don't put myself on Jeff Beck's level, but I can relate to him when he says he'd rather be working on his car collection than playing the guitar.;Ritchie Blackmore;car
The thing people don't understand is that touring or travelling or whatever you do in my position means you go to all these cool places all over the world, but you see everything from a car window. You don't get to see much of the city or meet people at all.;Taylor Momsen;car
I'm just attracted to playing people who are ostensible unlikable. That's not to say that there's something in there that makes you care. It might be that you just find them so awful that you just can't stop watching, like a car crash.;Steve Coogan;car
I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.;Peter Steele;car
I don't actually own a car.;Chris Martin;car
The only thing I do on a computer is play Texas Hold 'Em, really. Obviously my cell phone is a computer. My car is a computer. I'm on computers every day without actively seeking them out.;John Hawkes;car
Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the '50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together.I would hear him sing every night.;Etta James;car
But I have a driver, so I can return calls while I'm in the car.;Donna Shalala;car
L.A. has a fantastic car scene and because the climate is so gentle, cars can last forever.;Lee Child;car
I'd really like to get the girl, shoot the gun, drive the car, have fun. I even have these kind of action dreams, where I'm the action guy.;Kevin Bacon;car
I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.;Quincy Jones;car
I sing in the car if I'm in LA, because you're like soundproofed.;Jimmy Fallon;car
We had the guys from X Men 2 do the cameras. They had a 360 camera that would go from one car, up in the air and over to another car in a continuous shot while the film was still rolling, going 90 mph.;Jimmy Fallon;car
In New York, you've got Donald Trump, Woody Allen, a crack addict and a regular Joe, and they're all on the same subway car.;Ethan Hawke;car
I was turning 20 during my first record. Those decade birthdays always kind of cause me, it seems, to reflect, look back, and then look forward. I just was closing this period of my life where I was living in a car and scrambling my whole life to then signing a six-record deal with Atlantic.;Jewel;car
In addition to this, they already have a fuel cell car on the road in Japan. It is subsidized from within the corporation because they are still at a high cost.;Maurice Strong;car
Toyota was the first to put a commercial fuel cell powered car on the road, and I have no doubt that Toyota will continue to be in the front lines in the development of competitive fuel cell vehicles.;Maurice Strong;car
I borrowed my friend's car the other day in an attempt to persuade my husband that we needed a car and literally this is true, in the first day of borrowing the car, I got three tickets and I rear-ended it.;Emily Mortimer;car
I used to look like a deer in headlights on the red carpet. You step out of the car and it's bedlam. Everyone's got crazy eyes.;Emily Blunt;car
Well, I've been in a few car wrecks.;Dave Matthews;car
I don't want a flashy car, just something that would allow me to stop using the Tube. And it would be good not to have to rely on my mum all the time, particularly when I have to listen to her singing in her car.;Andy Murray;car
When you read about a car crash in which two or three youngsters are killed, do you pause to dwell on the amount of love and treasure and patience parents poured into bodies no longer suitable for open caskets?;Jim Bishop;car
A life can get knocked into a new orbit by a car crash, a lottery win or just a bleary-eyed consultant giving bad news in a calm voice.;David Mitchell;car
Home, nowadays, is a place where part of the family waits till the rest of the family brings the car back.;Earl Wilson;car
With all the hybrid stuff and things like that, I think that's a fabulous direction to go with cars in that sense. As someone who grew up around muscle cars, I'll never not be able to not love a muscle car. Not that I don't care about the environment, that's not it. But I adore muscle cars.;Michael Symon;car
I don't even own a car.;Bill Nighy;car
Of course, I'm older now. I'm in a different place in my life than when I wrote the songs for 'Car Wheels' or 'Essence' or whatever. Different things were going on.;Lucinda Williams;car
I hate fishing, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike when you can get in the car and drive.;Joseph Barbera;car
I would make tea for Joni Mitchell or clean her car, anything to be in the studio and watch her work.;Sheena Easton;car
If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car, it'll be the last car he'll ever lay down in front of.;George C. Wallace;car
I am endlessly busy, bringing up five young kids, and trying to keep up with the three older ones. I still spend most of my life driving car pools.;Danielle Steel;car
Yes, I did and a lot of my friends who are in the same program as I were very much supportive, and the most important thing they said to me is do not let this interfere with what you have to do in taking car of yourself. That was the most important thing.;Naomi Campbell;car
I read murder mysteries. I exercise 40 minutes a day. I watch videotapes while I exercise. I listen to audiotapes when I am in my car. And I try to stay in three different centuries.;Grover Norquist;car
People don't understand that it was maybe my biggest pleasure to drive an F1 car when it's wet.;Alain Prost;car
The people who criticise you will not be the ones taking care of your legs when you are in your wheelchair. People who never drove a car in these conditions, they just don't know.;Alain Prost;car
When you're in a car which can win every race, or fight for a win every race, that is pressure.;Jenson Button;car
We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.;Jenson Button;car
We all drive differently and have different styles. For me I need a car I can develop beneath me and feel comfortable in. If the car feels neutral and unbalanced it doesn't work for me.;Jenson Button;car
I need to develop a car and engineer a car in a position that feels comfortable for me, and I don't think anyone can do a better job than I can in that position. The problem for me is if I can't get the car there I do struggle more than some.;Jenson Button;car
To understand the intensity of driving an F1 car, you have to be in it. When you're driving a 750hp machine at 200mph, the noise and the vibrations are incredible. The G-force when you take big corners is like someone trying to rip your head off. You hit the brakes, and it feels as if the skin is being pulled off your body.;Jenson Button;car
To drive an F1 car you have to be a little mad. On the morning of a race there's a mix of excitement and fear. If it's a wet track, then it's worse as you're not in control most of the time, which is the thing all drivers fear the most.;Jenson Button;car
When I do retire, I know for a fact that I'll never be able to replace the incredible feeling I get when I'm driving an F1 car.;Jenson Button;car
In the car and in front of the camera I tend to be very calm but behind the scenes I can get fired up and passionate, I just don't see the need to shout my mouth off in public.;Jenson Button;car
I don't purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn't give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can't go fast enough. It's never going to be anything like an F1 car.;Jenson Button;car
The fast, flowing parts, the high-speed corners, that's where a Formula One car is at its best - changes of direction, pulling high g-forces left and right.;Jenson Button;car
A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we're pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.;Jenson Button;car
I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I'm 6ft and I'm 70kg so I haven't much fat on me.;Jenson Button;car
You're pulling 4-5G for a lot of the corners around the lap. We build up lactic acid because there are a lot of vibrations in the car, and you have to have strong legs to hit the brake pedal. We need to be fit to do every lap at 100%.;Jenson Button;car
When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.;Chris Pratt;car
Television is such an evolving medium. When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.;Chris Pratt;car
If your goal is to be the biggest movie star in the world, a 10-movie contract is gold. It was never my goal. Up until now, I made movies - and I have a nice house, a nice car. I'm fortunate, happy and grateful. Life is good.;Chris Evans;car
It's that I don't like white paper backgrounds. A woman does not live in front of white paper. She lives on the street, in a motor car, in a hotel room.;Helmut Newton;car
Most of us would never consider getting our car repaired without first receiving an estimate of the charges, but this is exactly what we do when we need to go to a hospital for treatment.;Dan Lipinski;car
My very best friend died in a car accident when I was 16 years old. That was the hardest blow emotionally that I have ever had to endure. Suddenly, you realize tomorrow might not come. Now I live by the motto, 'Today is what I have.';Amber Heard;car
I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad's a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I've always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.;Amber Heard;car
We talked about many issues, like welfare, is it the way of life or hand up? Talked about size of government, how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said, 'I'll be damned. we're Republicans.';Susana Martinez;car
Sometimes I feel like I'm not only the engine but the caboose. I have to be in the front car and pull forward, and at the same time run around behind and push everybody along with me.;Sandra Lee;car
That's what I love. Not being interrupted, sitting in a car by myself and listening to music in the rain. There are so many great songs yet to sing.;Alison Krauss;car
I know I will die in a car crash.;Katie Price;car
I married a pretty famous girl, and when we drive through town there's usually a car following us, when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there's six guys waiting for me.;Kevin Pietersen;car
I've tried everything other than jumping out of a plane, but nothing gives you an adrenaline rush like racing a car.;Nigel Mansell;car
I take cabs if I need to get somewhere or I take car service. I don't drive, I wouldn't mind riding a bike... People think that because you become an entertainer you gotta have this rock star thug image. I'm an artist, man. I'm going to live like an artist.;ASAP Rocky;car
The energy of the crowd is insane. Twenty thousand people. It's the biggest jolt of adrenaline. It's very hard to explain. You know the old story about the woman lifting the car off her kid? It's in that realm. You can actually hurt yourself and not know it.;Tom Petty;car
The first time I rode a bike I was four or five. I crashed into the back of a car.;David Millar;car
If one's honest about it, spending time in a car with children is pretty ghastly.;Arabella Weir;car
I lived on the top of one hill and the school was at the top of another hill. Nobody ever went to school by car - we didn't have any cars during the war. So that to and from school was itself a training.;Roger Bannister;car
It's a tricky place, especially the last sector. I wasn't happy in practice. I wasn't happy with the car and I wasn't happy with myself. But I always thought there was more in the car.;Sebastian Vettel;car
Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
All in all it was a smooth race, the car was very well balanced. I'm very proud to be the first winner here in India.;Sebastian Vettel;car
There is no secret, once we go to qualifying, we all seem to enjoy it. Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
When you walk the track and you see a corner and realise you were going round it at 160mph, you wonder who could be so stupid to take a corner at that speed. But in the car, you don't even think about that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
Simply racing a Formula 1 car is an achievement.;Sebastian Vettel;car
We always kept believing in ourselves and our team and the car.;Sebastian Vettel;car
I could never drive in a great big car people like me because I'm a man of the people, a hustler.;Terry McAuliffe;car
Life's too short when you find yourself sitting in a car for four hours every day trying to get from East L.A. to West L.A. to Hollywood and then back to East L.A.;Garrett Hedlund;car
I was an economics major in college, and every summer after school, I would drive my car from California, from Claremont men's college at the time, to New York. And I worked on Wall Street.;Henry Kravis;car
Divorced men are more likely to meet their car payments than their child support obligations.;Susan Faludi;car
I'm carded for R-rated movies. And I get talked down to a lot. When I try to go rent a car or buy an airplane ticket or other stuff adults do, I get 'Okaaaaaay, honey.' I remember when I was 18, getting crayons in a restaurant.;Kristen Bell;car
When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into a GPS device, whose spatial memory supplants my own. I have photographs to store the images I want to remember, books to store knowledge and now, thanks to Google, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind's collective memory.;Joshua Foer;car
I own stock, and I also insure my car with Geico.;Ernie Banks;car
My next adventure will be being in a car with Mischa at the wheel.;Rachel Bilson;car
A few years ago I was at a party and this guy threw me over his shoulder, ran across the street, put me in his car, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.;Rachel Bilson;car
People go to car races to watch the crashes.;Johnny Knoxville;car
Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.;Jim Harrison;car
A woman is gentle, soft, delicate, and a man's position is to protect her, help her up stairs, make sure she's in the car safely first. Take good care of your woman, and the sky's the limit!;Taraji P. Henson;car
I'm a crazy car guy. I've got an airplane hangar full of cars.;Paul Walker;car
You know, if you're Guy Kawasaki and you create a car that gets 500 miles a gallon with zero emissions, people on the Internet would say: 'I could have done that in half an hour, and it's been done before. What's the big deal? I expected something more from him.' Meanwhile, they didn't do it, right? They're still living at home with their mothers.;Guy Kawasaki;car
We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, 'Don't worry about winning': If you win I'll get you ice cream, but if you lose I'm going to pout in the car.;Bode Miller;car
It's so funny looking back, but my so-called overnight success actually took 15 years. I remember when I didn't have any money, and my only car was mom's Hyundai.;Criss Angel;car
I have mentally overcome situations most of you would be terrified to ever attempt: heights, fire, needles, spiders, snakes, angry monkeys, being shot, being hit by a car, going blind - you name it, I have been in a situation where I have had to mentally overcome my inherent fears to do my job.;Criss Angel;car
I'm starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I've driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there's nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.;Kevin O'Leary;car
I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don't drink any more, because that's when I thought, you know, I'm gonna end up a car wreck.;Kristin Davis;car
I'm a big potato chip girl. I don't like chocolate and cakes and all that, but I have to have my potato chips. I've got bags in the back of my car right now! But I never beat myself up about it, because, look: You can't give up every damn thing. You need something in your life that you like just because you like it!;NeNe Leakes;car
I've always been an avid reader. If I don't have a book in the car, I'll stop and pick one up just to have something to read. I don't even remember learning to read.;Janis Ian;car
My work is more about trying to ask good questions and not trying to come up with big shows. Every fashion company is doing that, every car company is doing that.;Laurie Anderson;car
Every song has a composer, every book has an author, every car has a maker, every painting has a painter, and every building has a builder. So it isn't irrational to take this simple logic a little further and say that nature must have had a Maker. It would be irrational to believe that it made itself.;Ray Comfort;car
Here's the thing that I think about life - if you manage to get into a space where you don't need that much, where the overhead of your life is not that great and you're pretty happy and relaxed without that much stuff, you are really liberated because you never have to say yes to something because you want another refrigerator or car!;Brit Marling;car
The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.;Bob Uecker;car
I'd like to have the flying car, I think that'd be really cool.;Rupert Grint;car
Anyone can write a story based on the kind of horror where you see a guy in car and then there's the bad guy in the back seat. It's infantile to rely on that for telling a story. That's like going to bed and thinking there's a monster under your bed. It's silly.;Sergio Aragones;car
I always loved music. You know, my parents said I started singing when I was 4, in the car.;Bob Seger;car
I think fear is what keeps us from going over the edge. I mean, as a race car driver, I don't think what makes a good race car driver is a fearless person. I think it's somebody that is comfortable being behind the wheel of something that's somewhat out of control.;Jeff Gordon;car
I really enjoy not getting in a car and running errands on bikes.;Stone Gossard;car
To say that I am organized is an understatement, but my car tells a different story.;Emily Procter;car
I lived in small town out in the desert and my friend used to steal his mom's car in the middle of the night. He'd drive over to my house, I'd sneak out and we'd go out to the desert and just burn things down.;Mark Hoppus;car
So, I remember when I was a kid, I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late, and, you know, I was like, 'Oh my God, what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?' I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.;Vinny Guadagnino;car
On my job I end up jumping out of planes. Last week I got in an 18-wheeler and drove down a runway onto a skid track. The week before that they put me in a car and sunk me to the bottom of a lake to see if I could escape without an oxygen tank.;Rick Mercer;car
In L.A., I don't really want to go out because traffic sucks so bad. I'm sorry, I'm not going to spend five hours a day in my car, so you have to choose where you live very carefully.;Holly Madison;car
I quit after a bad car accident. The thing about boxing is that you can be a star for five or six years, but when you go back to the old life, it's tough.;Olivier Martinez;car
A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.;Edie Brickell;car
I hate modern car radios. In my car, I don't even have a push-button radio. It's just got a dial and two knobs. Just AM. One knob makes it louder, and one knob changes the station. When you're driving, that's all I want.;Chris Isaak;car
I once went to one of those parties where everyone throws their car keys into the middle of the room. I don't know who got my moped, but I drove that Peugeot for years.;Victoria Wood;car
Come rain or shine I walk short distances rather than taking my car.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;car
I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.;Ellen Page;car
The way you continue to be a successful business is you don't wait for the car to go off the cliff. You have to manage yourself. And make sure you do it in the right way so you are not making decisions in crisis.;Roger Goodell;car
We each own one car, and we have a reasonable house. It's a lovely place to be, but it's not extravagant.;Reese Witherspoon;car
As soon as I began to earn what might be called fairly large sums, I bought a car and began to explore the country around New York.;Kate Smith;car
If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn't you help him?;Oskar Schindler;car
One thing that worried me was how writers get categorized and so they end up having to write the same kind of book again and again. That is fine if it is what you want to do, but I would rather be locked in the trunk of my car with a weasel than write the same book every three years until I die.;Justin Cronin;car
I've worked as a labourer, driven taxis and school buses, and been a car mechanic - whatever I could do just to get by. But it does mean that I know a little bit about a lot of things.;Cory Monteith;car
What I enjoy doing more than anything is, I have my little antique car collection, and when the weather is pretty I like to get out one of my old cars. I have a little route I run down in the country, down Nachez Trace Parkway. The loop down through there is just really relaxing, not much traffic.;Alan Jackson;car
I am a horrible visual artist. I can't fix a car, sew, knit, cook, etc. Statistically, there is more I don't do than do.;Carrie Brownstein;car
The word 'geek' today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.;Olivia Munn;car
A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.;Olivia Munn;car
In the heat of the Russian summer a sleeping car is the most horrible instrument of martyrdom imaginable.;Manfred von Richthofen;car
When I grew up there wasn't air-conditioning or anything of that nature, and this old car had a wall thickness of about ten inches. So we had a little warmer house in the winter and a little cooler in the summer.;Merle Haggard;car
It sounds like something from a Woody Guthrie song, but it's true I was raised in a freight car.;Merle Haggard;car
There were times when I thought I would never own a car.;Victor Cruz;car
The image is where you have dinner at night, who you're seeing. It's what car you drive and how you dress. People in the industry sell that, and it creates a dream. There's nothing else.;Elle Macpherson;car
I'm the one who gets called up about a problem. I'm the one who gets called up about the street lighting and the abandoned car. I'm the one who gets blamed if the police don't arrive. I'm the one they blame if a city truck is broken down.;Richard M. Daley;car
You know, it's amazing. I don't even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I've got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;car
I always keep a ball in the car. You never know.;Hakeem Olajuwon;car
I've made movies that cost less than one car chase.;Sam Mendes;car
In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.;Willie Mays;car
Some people think my father was a spy, because of working for that government agency in Vietnam, but he can't find his car keys, much less keep a national secret.;Lauren Graham;car
All I want to know is that I can keep this house for the rest of my days and I want to make good music... and have the odd sports car in the garage, obviously!;Jay Kay;car
It's not a case of 'look at me in my car' it's more, 'look at the car'. I like the idea of other people enjoying them, because everything has become a bit faceless and nobody likes the motor car any more.;Jay Kay;car
I didn't get my first car until I was 22. It was a BMW 1602 and now I've got it back I'm waiting to restore it.;Jay Kay;car

The United Nations four or five years ago put out a study that said the meat industry, meat-eating, growing meat for food is the No. 1 killer of our planet - not No. 2 or No. 3: No 1. You know what's No. 2? Transportation. Everyone thinks that No. 1 is transportation, and goes out and buys a hybrid car. Screw the hybrid cars. Don't eat hamburgers.;Maggie Q;car
You cannot expect the guy who drove the car into the ditch to navigate it out of the ditch. You have to put a new driver in the seat. I'm not saying the new driver is going to be any better, but we need a new driver. Kerry is the only choice.;John Mellencamp;car
The idea that maybe you don't have to own a car if you only need one occasionally may catch on, just like time-sharing caught on in real estate.;Steve Case;car

I took guitar a while back, and my heart wasn't in it at the time, but I'm ready to try it again. I sing in the car, at home - it's a huge part of my life, especially since I'm from Tennessee.;Lucy Hale;car
I love Lady Antebellum and Miranda Lambert - they write from the heart. But it's hard to find a country music lover in L.A. None of my friends really listen to it, and they hate getting in the car with me because I just blast Taylor Swift.;Lucy Hale;car
I definitely love that all these car brands are coming out with hybrid forms of every car that they have. It's very awesome because I think it does make a difference, and it doesn't hurt that you save a lot of money on gas.;Lucy Hale;car
I've always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.;Ludacris;car
Paul is Starsky, and I met him before shooting. He was very kind and encouraged us to go with what we wanted to do. It was very sweet to see them back with the car after 25 years.;Ben Stiller;car
I grew up in Texas and we used to go to Padre Island, eight hours in the car down to the beach.;St. Vincent;car
My dad used to love Steely Dan, the Stones, Jethro Tull and all that. There was always Steely Dan going in my dad's car, but I remember The Royal Scam in particular because it has 'Kid Charlemagne' on it.;St. Vincent;car
When I was in New York, I was making a living. We had a summer house and a car that I could put in a garage. That's something for a stage actor.;William H. Macy;car
Your car should drive itself. It's amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It's a bug that cars were invented before computers.;Eric Schmidt;car
Consider the perverse effect cap and trade has on altruistic actions. Say you decide to buy a small, high-efficiency car. That reduces your emissions, but not your country's. Instead it allows somebody else to buy a bigger S.U.V. - because the total emissions are set by the cap.;James Hansen;car
Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases, load our kids into the car, and drive from tense, crowded New York City to my family's cottage in Maine. It's on an island, with stretches of sea and sandy beaches, rocky coasts, and pine trees. We barbecue, swim, lie around, and try to do nothing.;Hope Davis;car
It's like, no matter what I do, I always feel like I'm five years old, and I end up in the back of my father's car looking out the window, and nothing has changed in 25 years.;Dylan McDermott;car

I remember when metal was something you really had to search out, and now I hear it on car commercials.;Trevor Dunn;car

The ought to be a worldwide cultural taskforce that just stops you when you have ideas like combining The Red Desert with an armored car heist movie.;Steven Soderbergh;car
Well, it is so difficult right now when you look out on the road and how fast people go and the more and more cars you see out there, for teenagers, you'd think a kid that literally, a few years before, was sitting back in a car seat in the back seat is now behind the wheel.;Amy Klobuchar;car
But I also like to shower my parents with presents. I bought them a beautiful car and a house.;Eva Herzigova;car

Going to car racing school was phenomenal.;Michelle Rodriguez;car
A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you, you can hunt for food with it - you know, the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process, right? You know: the knife cuts the steak, stabs the person, saves somebody from danger, cuts somebody out of a car.;Peter Guber;car
I've made club songs, and I've made radio songs, and I've made the car songs.;T-Pain;car
My first car was an '84 Ford Taurus. It caught on fire from me trying to change the fuel pump, so that wasn't good at all. Dried leaves on the ground while I was trying to change the fuel pump. Don't do that. Do it on concrete.;T-Pain;car
We need a number of solutions - we need more efficiency and conservation. Efficiency is a big one. I think car companies need to do a lot better in producing more efficient cars. They have the technology, we just need to demand them as consumers.;Daryl Hannah;car
Twenty years ago, I was living in a lovely cottage on the edge of Dartmoor but I couldn't afford to run a car.;Mary Wesley;car

Because of that I don't care when I read in the newspaper that I am colourblind. I went through a red light in my car and I stopped when I before a green light. So I must be really colourblind, eh?;Ruud van Nistelrooy;car
The courts cannot garnish a father's salary, nor freeze his account, nor seize his property on behalf of his children, in our society. Apparently this is because a kid is not a car or a couch or a boat.;June Jordan;car
Mayors could never get away with the kind of nonsense that goes on in Washington. In our world, you either picked up the trash or you didn't. You either moved an abandoned car or you didn't. You either filled a pothole or you didn't. That's what we do every day. And we know how to get this stuff done.;Michael Nutter;car
The negative effects of combat were nightmares, and I'd get jumpy around certain noises and stuff, but you'd have that after a car accident or a bad divorce. Life's filled with trauma. You don't need to go to war to find it it's going to find you. We all deal with it, and the effects go away after awhile. At least they did for me.;Sebastian Junger;car
In college, my big money memory was saving up to buy a car with my boyfriend, whom I lived with.;Christie Hefner;car
I think I'm pretty smart on what I spend my money on. I still don't have a new car, I drive my old car that I've had forever. But I bought a house in downtown Chicago.;Chris O'Donnell;car

There are going to be little victories that we claim, even if it's finishing 15th and putting the car back in hauler without a scratch on it.;Kurt Busch;car
This is like my dad's race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn't race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.;Kurt Busch;car
So there is going to be that balance of understanding how to get the best out of the car that day, whether it's 15th or even if I have a shot at a top 10, protecting that car so we can bring it back when we have to.;Kurt Busch;car
It's just that fun atmosphere, working on the car, being with the guys. This is exactly what I needed.;Kurt Busch;car
James Finch is exactly what I'm looking for, as far as getting back into the race car to have fun.;Kurt Busch;car

People spend so much time in their cars, and it's a legal way to have fun by speeding a little bit or testing yourself a little bit, and you get to invest in your car. For some people, it becomes their baby.;Jordana Brewster;car

I knew that by getting behind the wheel of the car and having had something to drink, the responsibility laid on my shoulders.;Tracey Gold;car
I remember that all of a sudden, the car felt like I couldn't control it. It was absolutely the most horrifying experience. We rolled over, off the freeway. I think there was something wrong with the car.;Tracey Gold;car
I will never have a drink and get behind the wheel of a car. It's not illegal to drink and drive, but there becomes a certain point where it does become a crime.;Tracey Gold;car
I never listen to music in the house, I listen to music in the car.;Peter Tork;car
Investors have few spare tires left. Think of the image of a car on a bumpy road to an uncertain destination that has already used up its spare tire. The cash reserves of people have been eaten up by the recent market volatility.;Mohamed El-Erian;car
Now having said that, I realize that releasing a film in the real world is like trying to get General Motors to release a handmade car.;Godfrey Reggio;car

Eventually I did that, but it took a lot of twists and turns, and there were a year or two there where I was living with no money at all - no home, no car, no nothing. I was living in somebody's garage in Los Angeles at that point - for a year.;Renny Harlin;car
I could be on 52nd and Third in Manhattan up and ask a strange for directions and they will help you, that's a rural heart. Your car breaks down in the middle of Iowa or somewhere, or Tennessee where I'm from, people want to help each other. Given each opportunity, you see how people come together.;Rodney Atkins;car
If I test the car for a year I can be quite competitive the next season.;Valentino Rossi;car

It used to be that you'd have a song recorded by a major country artist and if it was a hit, you could buy a car. Now you can buy a dealership.;Tom T. Hall;car
When I finish an album and I find myself listening to it in the car, because it makes me feel a certain way, that's the time to try to let other people know about it.;Herb Alpert;car
I don't think radio is selling records like they used to. They'd hawk the song and hawk the artist and you'd get so excited, you'd stop your car and go into the nearest record store.;Herb Alpert;car
I did a lot of gasoline commercials - Hess, Texaco. I was part of the family in the car, the little brat in the back.;Ricky Schroder;car

The thing about drugs and sex is that you lose all your inhibitions. I've had sex in trains, planes, wine bars... and quite a few car parks!;Robbie Williams;car

I think, like everybody else in New Hampshire, when I pull up to fill up my car and I pay $50, I get upset. And I'm wondering if these prices are legitimate.;Judd Gregg;car
I was in prison for a charge in Texas, murder one. Back in the '70s in Texas, I was there. I heard the shot. I was in the car.;Duane Chapman;car
Faith is the substance of hope - of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. So if you can hope for it and imagine it, and keep imagining and hoping and seeing yourself driving a new car, or seeing yourself getting that job, or seeing yourself excel, seeing yourself help that person - that is faith.;Duane Chapman;car
I'm gonna be the best dad that ever lived. I'll have a ranch with a race car track and a golf course.;Jeremy London;car

I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They'd be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we'd think: Oh, please Lord, don't make us go through that.;Paul Reiser;car
I think there's a suspicion in the South of people putting on airs. You see it in most successful Southern politicians, but you also see it in someone like Richard Petty, who may be a multimillionaire stock car driver, but he's also beloved because he has a nice self-deprecatory way about him.;John Shelton Reed;car
Is there some risk every day we walk out our front door? Every time we get in our car? Yeah. Are we materially less safe now than we were 10 years ago? Whatever delta there is, it's very small.;John Hickenlooper;car
It bothers me when I hear it in a car commercial or some such. But for the most part, it's better than seeing sacred music relegated to the scrap heap.;Richard Morris;car
The will is never free - it is always attached to an object, a purpose. It is simply the engine in the car - it can't steer.;Joyce Cary;car
I just completed a tour in Europe. I played every night. This requires traveling some days for six hours in a van or a train or a car. After six weeks of that, I checked into the hotel and just fell apart.;Lee Konitz;car
People would say you look weak if you're not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be 'strong' you're always supposed to be giving orders.;Georgios A. Papandreou;car
If you or me go to the gas station to fill up our car and it costs us much more than we expected, it will zap our discretionary income. We won't have the extra money to buy that washing machine or new winter coat-all big ticket items that are important to economic growth.;Maria Bartiromo;car

If I start outsourcing all my navigation to a little talking box in my car, I'm sort of screwed. I'm going to lose my car in the parking lot every single time.;Ken Jennings;car
I think that people don't know how to do anything anymore. My father was a janitor. He could take a car apart and put it back together. He could build a house in the back yard. Today, if you ask people what they know, they say, 'I know how to hire someone.';Walter Mosley;car
I mean, you have a general tone of it but it's pretty much you get to come in and you're going to flip this car and it's going to blow up and you're going to come out on fire and you go oh, that's cool, and then you get paid a lot of money.;David R. Ellis;car

I really like listening to music in my car.;Aaron Neville;car
There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I've always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.;Guy Fieri;car
It was all that stuff about taking your parents' car when you're 13, sneaking booze into rock shows and ditching school with your friends. I could relate to that as a former teenager, rather than as a present parent.;Donal Logue;car

The first trip I remember taking was on the train from Virginia up to New York City, watching the summertime countryside rolling past the window. They used white linen tablecloths in the dining car in those days, and real silver. I love trains to this day. Maybe that was the beginning of my fixation with leisurely modes of travel.;Billy Campbell;car
I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don't take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It's like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.;Luc Montagnier;car
I listen to KCRW in the car and Pandora radio, which I stream through the stereo from my iPhone. I've been listening to everything from Caribou to Conway Twitty. If I'm going on a longer car ride, I'll download some podcasts.;Sam Trammell;car

In the end I didn't get a top car any more. I had no toughness left. That was the reality.;Jacky Ickx;car

It's not just the kid who's spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars, it's also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car, because it's more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel, to be quite honest.;Richard Hammond;car
I've been in a car three or four times when it filled with water and it's not a comfortable feeling.;Richard Hammond;car

The thing about New York is you can leave your house without a plan and find the day. You can't do that in Los Angeles. You need to get in your car, all this, you can't just drive around like a lunatic. In New York, you can literally walk outside, and wind up anywhere.;Michael Rapaport;car

We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.;Jackie Stewart;car

I'd rather drive the yellow brick road, you wouldn't happen to know of a rental car place around.;Ryan Stiles;car

As far as luxury goes, about the only thing I do is... I go first class all the way. I live on the road, so when I'm out there, I'm getting the nice hotel suite, I'm getting the luxury car, I'm eating the good food, and I make sure I take care of myself on the road.;Trish Stratus;car

The hardest part was when I was in high school not having a job and always being broke. I had to get to auditions without a car. I either took the bus or walked.;Cuba Gooding, Jr.;car
Accidents happen, whether they're car accidents, friendly fire, drug overdoses. Accidents happen, and they're tragic.

The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.;Martin McGuinness;car

Like all soul singers, I grew up singing in church but sometimes I would leave early and sit in the car listening to gospel band, The Blind Boys of Alabama. Hearing their lead singer Clarence made me connect the idea of church and show business and see how I could make a career singing music that stirred the soul.;Daryl Hall;car

Indy car racing is much more aggressive.;Emerson Fittipaldi;car
The racing driver's mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex. Because of the speed the car goes.;Emerson Fittipaldi;car

I don't want to rap about my car. How generic is that? Be creative.;Andy Milonakis;car

I remember being at Greenblatt's on Sunset, and some guy just walked straight up to me, and he had some bling on and whatever, and said something about a party down in Malibu and asked if I would jump in his car and go to the party. All I could think was, 'Who are you? I don't know you, and I don't care about how good your car is.';Yvonne Strahovski;car

I grew up where my parents would literally shove me in the car rather than have to say hello to a neighbor.;Amy Sherman-Palladino;car

Whenever I drive under a yellow light, I always kiss my finger and tap it on the roof of the car.;Jared Padalecki;car

That's when it really came together for me that I was in a Bond film, to have my own spy car!;Rick Yune;car

Especially in the car ride to and from gym. I find myself spacing out a lot, just visualizing what the Olympics would be like and just having such great role models.;Aly Raisman;car

So for a year I spent all my time hiding from Jack Charlton in the car park practising my skills.;Craig Johnston;car

The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger.;Nigel Mansell;car
It's sad that women characters have lost so much ground in popular movies. Didn't 'Thelma and Louise' prove that women want to see women doing things on film? Thelma and Louise were in a classic car they were being chased by cops they shot up a truck - and women loved it.;Robin Quivers;car
The very first time I was on a car in Atlanta, I saw the conductor - all conductors are white - ask a Negro woman to get up and take a seat farther back in order to make a place for a white man. I have also seen white men requested to leave the Negro section of the car.;Ray Stannard Baker;car

I talk to myself, especially in the car.;Chris Pine;car
You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.;Walter Russell Mead;car

Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it.

I look at the car park and myself and Dave Watson come in with our old cars, and these young lads come in with their new Porches. I think that society has changed, there seems to be a lack of respect nowadays.;Richard Gough;car
There are people who own cars and are getting free cell phones. A car helps one find a job, too. Where do you draw the line?;Timothy Griffin;car
See, what you're meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren't you? Well, I've always had fast cars. It's not that. It's the fear that you're past your best. It's the fear that the stuff you've done in the past is your best work.;Robbie Coltraine;car

Since September 11, security has been increased everywhere, and we have new IDs to get on to the Fox lot. I drove to the security gate, but realized I'd left my ID in my other car. I just broke into that voice - 'Hey, man, I'm Bart Simpson. Who else sounds like this?' The guard waved me through.;Nancy Cartwright;car
Unfortunately we don't have all the bits and pieces on the car that we had hoped to have by this stage so we've got to make as good a job as we can with what we have and we feel we are doing well with that at the moment.;David Leslie;car
But now I feel off the grid. I feel that I am not part of the culture. And because I don't have a car I don't really go anywhere to buy things. In fact, I have been in a slow process of selling and giving away everything I own.;Vincent Kartheiser;car
I've got a great team of engineers behind this race car. I've got a great bunch of mechanics that make it reliable. This car is developed to go out there and be better than the Reynard, and I feel that it is.;Al Unser;car

Then as everything, like I say, things started to come together, when things started to go our way, that's when you results started to come. I was no different driver. I was certainly learning every time I went in the car.;Dan Wheldon;car
I don't drive around London much. Any journey around Islington involves hundreds of speed bumps that seem to tear the bottom of your car off.;Alan Davies;car

There's an unseen force which lets birds know when you've just washed your car.;Denis Norden;car

I've still got that little freedom part of me that wants to have a car that looks really sexy.;Patrice O'Neal;car

'Blind Curve,' the book I'm working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour.

Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.;Andrew Gross;car

I am really looking forward to driving another of my father?s car at the show in Rotterdam.;Nelson Piquet;car
We couldn't get the car back until well after the end of the race and we had very little time for repairs.;John Surtees;car

There was a time in L.A. when I drove to 7-Eleven to go grocery shopping, and I locked my keys in my car, which wasn't insured.

When I was a kid, the only way I saw movies was from the back seat of my family's car at the drive-in.;Forest Whitaker;car
The trick at Le Mans is to get the car 'in the window.'

I like to sing in the car with the windows rolled down and hair blowing all over my face.;Lauren Alaina;car
It's funny I'm in some ways hopelessly masculine, but I don't fish, I don't hunt, I'm not that into sports. I can't fix a car. I think it's my point of view and the way I see the world.;Corey Stoll;car
Yes, my grandfather worked with Thomas Edison on the electric car, and he sold electric cars at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris.;Al Jardine;car
On one level, nothing's really changed in my life. I still drive my daughter in the car pool on Monday. But it's impossible not to be aware of this rush of attention it's impossible not to be seduced by it once you've entered into it, seduced by being unhappy when the attention wanes.;Michael Tolkin;car

I worked for this company that repossessed cars. Sure enough, the day after I quit, they repossessed my car, but that would probably be my strangest job to date. You have to work your way up to become a hardcore repo man.;Romany Malco;car
I sing both in my shower and in my car, mostly in my car, because I have this weird thing - whenever I'm singing to the radio - my friends kind of hate it - but I pick out the harmonies in my head, and I'm singing the harmonies to the tracks and I'm jamming it out.;Paul McDonald;car
I remember when I started off, my first car was a Kia Spectra. With a spoiler kit and some rims.;Gio Gonzalez;car

For an actor, you're rejected eight or ten times a day. All you've got to sell is yourself. You're not selling products, they're not turning down a car, they're turning you down. Most people can't handle that. Most people are essentially not set up that way.;Barry Corbin;car
Guys want a 500 horsepower car. I'd rather have one horsepower - in a horse. That's macho. You go to pick up your date and you show up on a horse.;Bryan Callen;car

I think it's particularly a distinctively American concept that resonates with American culture through biker culture. A motorcycle is an independent thing.

Get in the race car do what I do then go home. We don't have freedom to do anything anymore.;Tony Stewart;car

The fight is always the same within the Democratic Party, isn't it? The more things change, the more they stay the same.;Dee Dee Myers;change

I mean, I think we're put here on earth to make your own destiny, to begin with. I don't think there's anything you can do this way or that way to change anything.;Waylon Jennings;change
Maybe more climate activists will think about the climate change not as an international problem to be resolved in an air-conditioned meeting hall, but as a guerilla war to be fought in the streets.;Jeff Goodell;change
I don't think the Palestinian people or Afghan children or some other things I'm concerned about are at the top of other people's agendas - not right now, when America is going through such a recession and people are suffering across the board financially. But I think all that will change.;Patti Smith;change
One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won't jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.;Jeff Goodell;change
I've always looked the same. Since I was a child, I hated having to deal with my hair. I hated having to change my clothes. As a kid, I had a sailor shirt and the same old corduroy pants, and that's what I wanted to wear everyday.;Patti Smith;change

When the fabric of society is so rigid that it cannot change quickly enough, adjustments are achieved by social unrest and revolutions.;John Boyd Orr;change
President Obama's version of America is a divided one - pitting us against each other based on our income level, gender, and social status. His policies have failed! We are not better off than we were 4 years ago, and no rhetoric, bumper sticker, or campaign ad can change that.;Mia Love;change

The only thing I fear more than change is no change. The business of being static makes me nuts.;Twyla Tharp;change
The problem with being sure that God is on your side is that you can't change your mind, because God sure isn't going to change His.;Roger Ebert;change

When you first have a baby your life doesn't change. I mean, you have a little less sleep and you drag these cuddly things around you and it's just amazing. But you still get to be you.

I think if there's any difference between me and a traditional CEO, it's that I've been unwilling to change myself or shape my personality around what's expected.;Andrew Mason;change

The reality of split government puts a premium on creativity within the administration. President Obama needs to put the right people in charge of the agencies and then have them push the bounds of administrative power to change policy through those agencies. President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.;Eliot Spitzer;change
I'm not going to change the world overnight. It's one person at a time, and hopefully they're people in positions of power who can help people get in those roles and really, truly embrace colorblind casting.;Gabrielle Union;change
Really, each era has its own false nostalgia. We all put a picket fence up around something. For my generation it was the '50s, and for other generations it will be something else. Change is scary for everyone, as is complexity, contradiction, and an uncertain future.;Gary Ross;change
I always get bored with my hair. That's why I would always change it throughout my career.;Janet Jackson;change

Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever.;Paul Auster;change
I was advised by an American agent when I was about 19 to change my surname.;Rachel Weisz;change

As far as I was concerned, either I was a homosexual or I wasn't, so making films would change nothing.;Claude Chabrol;change

You must change in order to survive.;Pearl Bailey;change
We are like a woman with a difficult pregnancy. We have to rebuild the social classes in Egypt, and we must change the way things were.;Naguib Mahfouz;change
On the political front, of course it's a zero-sum game. If it's all white males holding positions, you bring 10 women in, then it's, 'Women are coming!' Get 10 blacks and it's, 'Blacks are coming!' 'Hispanics are coming!' Zero-sum game. The seatmates might change but the chairs don't move. In the economy, the number of chairs can actually increase.;Jesse Jackson;change

Fall is my favorite season in Los Angeles, watching the birds change color and fall from the trees.;David Letterman;change
Since 'Idol' I've gotten used to having an amazing hair and make-up team around me, so I'm starting to get picky.

I think I can change the game.;Venus Williams;change
As far as friendships go, things change even without the fame. People start moving on.

I also have friends who are just doing their own thing, which is cool.;Jordin Sparks;change
If I have to change my lifestyle, I don't want to live.;Robert Mapplethorpe;change
